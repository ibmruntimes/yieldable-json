Operate the vehicle in an environmentally responsible manner to make a contribution to environmental protection. To do this, observe the following recommendations on operating conditions and your personal driving style. Operating conditions: # Make sure that the tire pressures are \n\nalways correct. \n\n# Do not transport any unnecessary weight (e.g. a roof luggage rack which is no lon- ger required). \n\n# Observe the service intervals. \n\nA regularly serviced vehicle will contrib- ute to environmental protection. \n\n# Always have maintenance work carried out at a qualified specialist workshop. \n\nPersonal driving style: # Do not depress the accelerator pedal \n\nwhen starting the engine. \n\n# Do not warm up the vehicle while station- \n\nary. \n\n# Drive carefully and maintain a sufficient \n\ndistance to other vehicles. \n\nMercedes‑Benz AG offers recycled recondi- tioned components and parts with the same quality as new parts. The same entitlement from the Limited Warranty is valid as for new parts. # Use recycled reconditioned components and parts from Mercedes‑Benz AG. \n\n* NOTE Effectiveness of the restraint sys- tems impaired due to the installation of accessories, repairs or welding \n\nAir bags and emergency tensioning devices, as well as control units and sensors for the restraint systems, may be installed in the fol- lowing areas in your vehicle: R Door frames R Roof frame R Doors R Door pillars R Sills R Seats R Cockpit R Instrument cluster R Center console \n\n# Avoid frequent, sudden acceleration and \n\nbraking. \n\n# Do not install any accessories such as \n\naudio systems in these areas. \n\n# Shift gears in good time and use each \n\ngear only up to Ô of its maximum engine speed. \n\n# Do not carry out any repairs or welding. # Have accessories retrofitted at a quali- \n\nfied specialist workshop. \n\n# Switch off the vehicle in stationary traf- \n\nfic. \n\n# Drive in a fuel-efficient manner. Pay \n\nattention to the ECO display for a fuel- efficient driving style. \n\nEnvironmental issues and recommendations It is recommended that you re-use or recycle materials instead of just disposing of them. The relevant environmental guidelines and regula- tions serve to protect the environment and should be followed carefully. \n\nIf you use parts, tires, wheels or safety-relevant accessories which have not been approved by Mercedes-Benz , the operating safety of the vehi- cle may be jeopardized. Safety-critical systems such as the brake system may malfunction. Only use Mercedes-Benz Genuine Parts or parts of equal quality. Use only tires, wheels and accessory parts that are approved for your vehicle model. Mercedes-Benz tests original parts, conversion parts and accessory parts that have been approved for your vehicle model for reliability, safety and suitability. Despite ongoing market research, we are unable to assess other parts. We therefore accept no responsibility for the use of \n\n22 \n\nGeneral notes \n\nsuch parts in Mercedes-Benz vehicles, even if they have been officially approved or independently approved by a testing center. In some other countries, certain parts are officially approved for installation or modification only if they comply with legal requirements. All Mercedes- Benz Genuine Parts satisfy these requirements. Make sure that all parts are suitable for your vehi- cle. Always specify the vehicle identification number (VIN) and the engine number when ordering Mercedes-Benz Genuine Parts (/ page 272). \n\nInformation about Attachments, bodies, installa- tions and conversions \n\nNotes on body/equipment mounting directives For safety reasons, have bodies produced and installed in accordance with the valid Mercedes- Benz body/equipment mounting directives. These body/equipment mounting directives ensure that the chassis and body form one unit and that the greatest possible level of operational and driving safety is achieved. Both vehicle manufacturers and body manufactur- ers must always ensure that the products they manufacture come into circulation only in a safe state and do not pose any risks to people. Other- wise, there may be consequences under civil, crim- inal or public law. All manufacturers are responsi- ble for the products that they have manufactured. Manufacturers of attachments, bodies, installa- tions and conversions must guarantee compliance with Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety. Mercedes-Benz recommends the following proce- dure for safety reasons: R Do not make any other changes to the vehicle. R Obtain approval from the dealer named on the inside title page in the event of deviations from the approved body/equipment mounting direc- tives. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident and injury in \n\nthe event of improper conversions or changes to the vehicle \n\nConversions or changes to the vehicle can pre- vent systems or components from functioning properly and/or jeopardize the vehicle's operational safety. # Always have conversions or changes to the vehicle carried out at a qualified workshop. \n\nIf you intend to make changes to your vehicle, Mercedes-Benz strongly recommends that you contact the dealer. They will give you all the infor- mation you need. There may be a charge for this service. If body manufacturers and dealers make modifica- tions that affect the final inspection of the engine, vehicle or equipment, they must accept sole responsibility for the vehicle. This also applies to marking and documenting the vehicle parts affec- ted by the changes that they make. You are responsible for ensuring and providing evi- dence that the following conditions are met: R The vehicle complies with all relevant stand- ards and regulations that are affected by the modification. \n\nR The modified vehicle still meets the vehicle \n\nsafety standards and emissions laws and regu- lations. \n\nR The modification does not impair the safety of \n\nthe vehicle. \n\nMercedes-Benz is not responsible for the final inspection, product liability or warranty claims resulting from modification. This applies to the fol- lowing points: R The modified components or systems R The resultant violation of emissions laws and regulations or vehicle safety standards \n\nR All consequences resulting from the modified, \n\nAcceptance tests performed by public test bodies or official approvals do not rule out safety risks. Observe the information about Mercedes-Benz Genuine Parts (/ page 21). % You can obtain further information at a quali- \n\nfied specialist workshop. \n\nless safe or even faulty vehicle \n\nMercedes-Benz accepts no responsibility as final manufacturer or for the resultant product liability. \n\nNotes on the radiator Even seemingly minor changes to the vehicle, such as attaching a radiator grille in winter, are not per- mitted. Do not cover the radiator. Do not use any thermal mats, insect protection covers, etc. \n\nGeneral notes \n\n23 \n\nOtherwise, the values of the vehicle's diagnostic system will be distorted. Some of these values are prescribed by law and must be correct at all times. \n\nService and vehicle operation \n\nWarranty \n\nNotes on the cargo floor The factory equips the vehicle with a wooden or plastic cargo floor; this is an integral part of the vehicle structure. If you have the cargo floor removed, the vehicle body may be damaged. Load securing will then be impaired and the maximum loading capacity of the tie-down points will no lon- ger be guaranteed. Therefore, do not have the cargo floor removed. \n\nNotes on the partition Without a partition, vehicles that are approved as commercial vehicles (N1, N2) do not fulfill ISO 27956, which describes the equipment for properly securing a load in delivery vehicles. If the vehicle is used to transport goods, retrofitting the partition is strongly recommended, as properly securing the load in vehicles without a partition will always be complex. \n\nOperator's Manual This Operator's Manual describes all models, as well as standard and optional equipment of your vehicle that was available at the time of going to press. Country-specific differences are possible. Note that your vehicle may not be equipped with all the functions described. This is also the case for systems and functions relevant to safety.

If you do not inform the buyer, this may constitute a punishable offense under national legislation. \n\nQualified specialist workshop A qualified specialist workshop has the necessary special skills, tools and qualifications to correctly carry out any necessary work on your vehicle. This particularly applies to work relevant to safety. Always have the following work on the vehicle car- ried out at a qualified specialist workshop: R Safety-relevant works R Service and maintenance work R Repair work R Modifications as well as installations and con- \n\nversions \n\nR Work on electronic component parts \n\nMercedes-Benzrecommends that you use an authorized Mercedes-Benz for this purpose. \n\nThe connection and use of another device on the diagnostics connection can have the following effects: R Malfunctions in the vehicle system R Permanent damage to vehicle components \n\nPlease refer to the warranty terms and conditions regarding this. In addition, connecting equipment to the diagnos- tics connection can lead to emissions monitoring information being reset, for example. This may lead to the vehicle failing to meet the requirements of the next emissions inspection during the main inspection. \n\nVehicle registration Mercedes-Benz may ask its service centers to carry out technical inspections on certain vehicles. The quality or safety of the vehicle is improved as a result of the inspection. Mercedes-Benz can only inform you about vehicle checks if it Mercedes-Benz has your registration data. In the following cases your vehicle may not be reg- istered to you yet: R you did not purchase your vehicle at an author- \n\nised specialist dealer. \n\nR your vehicle has not yet been inspected at an \n\nauthorized Mercedes-Benz Center. \n\nGeneral notes \n\n27 \n\nIt is advisable to register your vehicle with an authorized Mercedes-Benz Center. Inform Mercedes-Benz as soon as possible about any change in address or vehicle ownership. You can do this, for example, at an authorized Mercedes-Benz Center. \n\nIn a rollover crash, an unbelted person is signifi- cantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt. You and all vehicle occupants should always wear seat belts. \n\nCorrect use of the vehicle If you remove warning stickers, you or others may fail to recognize the dangers. Leave warning stick- ers in position. Observe the following information in particular when operating the vehicle: R Safety notes in these operating instructions R Technical data for the vehicle R Traffic rules and regulations R Laws pertaining to motor vehicles and safety \n\nstandards \n\nMulti Purpose vehicle \n\nNotes for persons with electronic medical aids Mercedes-Benz AG cannot, despite carefully devel- oping vehicle systems, completely rule out the interaction of vehicle systems with electronic med- ical aids such as cardiac pacemakers. In addition, there are components built into the vehicle that, regardless of the operating status of your vehicle, can generate magnetic fields on a par with permanent magnets. These fields can be found, for example, in the area around the multi- media and sound system or also in the seating area, depending on the vehicle equipment. For this reason, the following can occur in isolated cases, depending on the aids used: R Medical aids malfunctioning R Adverse health effects \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident when the cen- \n\nter of gravity is too high \n\nThe vehicle may start to skid and rollover in the event of sudden steering maneuvers and/or when the vehicle's speed is not adapted to the road conditions. # Always adapt your speed and driving \n\nstyle to the vehicle's driving characteris- tics and to the prevailing road and weather conditions. \n\nObserve the notes and warnings of the manufac- turer of the medical aids; if in doubt, contact the device manufacturer and/or your doctor. If there is continuing uncertainty concerning the possibility of medical aids malfunctioning, Mercedes-Benz AG recommends using only few electrical vehicle sys- tems and/or maintaining a distance from the com- ponents. Only have repairs and maintenance work in the area of the following components carried out at a qualified specialist workshop: R Vehicle components carrying live voltage R Transmission antenna R Multimedia system and sound system \n\nIf you have any queries or suggestions, consult a qualified specialist workshop. \n\nUtility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles. Unsafe operation of the vehicle can result in an accident or rollover, as well as serious or even fatal injuries. \n\nInformation on problems with your vehicle If you should experience a problem with your vehi- cle, particularly one that you believe may affect its safe operation, we urge you to contact an author- ized Mercedes-Benz Center immediately to have the problem diagnosed and rectified.

Control units process data which they receive from vehicle sensors, forexample, generate them- selves or exchange between themselves. Some control units are required for the safe operation of \n\nGeneral notes \n\n29 \n\nyour vehicle, some assist you when driving, suchas driver assistance systems, while others enable convenience or infotainment functions. The following provides you with general informa- tion regarding data processing in the vehicle. Addi- tional information regarding exactly which data in your vehicle are collected, saved and transmitted to third parties, and for what purpose, can be found in the information directly related to the functional characteristics in question in their respective Operator's Manual. This information is also available online and, depending on the vehicle equipment, digitally. \n\nPersonal data Every vehicle is identified by a unique vehicle iden- tification number. Depending on the country, this vehicle identification number can be used by, forexample, governmental authorities to determine the identity of the owner. There are other possibili- ties for using data collected from the vehicle to identify the owner or driver, suchas the license plate number. Therefore, data generated or processed by control units may be attributable to a person or, under cer- tain conditions, become attributable to a person. Depending on which vehicle data are available, it may be possible to make inferences about, forexample, your driving behavior, your location, your route or your use patterns. \n\nLegal requirements regarding the disclosure of data If legally required to do so, manufacturers are, in individual cases, legally obliged to provide govern- mental entities, upon request and to the extent required, data stored by the manufacturer. Forexample, this may be the case during the inves- tigation of a criminal offense. Governmental entities are themselves, in individual cases and within the applicable legal framework, authorized to read out data from the vehicle. In the case of an accident, information that can help with an investigation can, therefore, be taken from the air bag control unit, forexample. \n\nOperational data in the vehicle This is data regarding the operation of the vehicle, which have been processed by control units. This includes the following data, forexample: R Vehicle status information suchas the speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, \n\nnumber of wheel revolutions or the fastened seat belts display \n\nR Ambient conditions, suchas temperature, rain \n\nsensor or distance sensor \n\nGenerally, these are volatile data and will not be stored beyond the period of operation but will only be processed within the vehicle itself. Control units, forexample vehicle keys, often contain data memories. Their use permits the temporary or per- manent documentation of technical information about the vehicle's operating state, component loads, maintenance requirements and technical events or malfunctions. Depending on the technical equipment, the follow- ing data are stored: R Operating status of system components, \n\nsuchas fill levels, tire pressure or battery status R Malfunctions or malfunctions in important sys- tem components, suchas lights or brakes R System reactions in special driving situations, suchas air bag deployment or the intervention of stability control systems \n\nR Information on events in which the vehicle is \n\ndamaged \n\nIn certain cases, it may be required to store data that would have otherwise been temporary. This may be the case if the vehicle has detected a mal- function, forexample. If you use services suchas repair services and maintenance work, stored operational data as well as the vehicle identification number can be read out and used. They can be read out by service net- work employees, suchas workshops and manufac- turers or third parties, suchas breakdown services. The same is true in the case of warranty claims and quality assurance measures. In general, the readout is performed via the legally prescribed port for the diagnostics connection in the vehicle. The operational data that are read out document technical states of the vehicle or of indi- vidual components and assist in the diagnosis of malfunctions, compliance with warranty obliga- tions and quality improvement. To that end, this data – in particular information about component loads, technical events, malfunctions and other malfunctions – may be transmitted along with the vehicle identification number to the manufacturer. In addition, the manufacturer is subject to product liability. For this reason, the manufacturer also uses operational data from the vehicle, forexam- ple, for recalls. These data can also be used to \n\n30 \n\nGeneral notes \n\nexamine the customer's warranty and guarantee claims. Malfunction memories in the vehicle can be reset by a service outlet or at your request as part of repair or maintenance work. \n\nConvenience and infotainment functions You can store convenience settings and individual settings in the vehicle and change or reset them at any time. Depending on the vehicle equipment, this includes the following settings, forexample: R Seat and steering wheel positions R Suspension and climate control settings R Individual settings, suchas interior lighting \n\nDepending on the selected equipment, you can import data into vehicle infotainment functions yourself. Depending on the vehicle equipment, this includes the following data, forexample: R Multimedia data, suchas music, films or photos for playback in an integrated multimedia sys- tem \n\ninformation, please consult the Operator's Manual for the vehicle or the infotainment system. This integration allows the use of selected smart- phone apps, suchas navigation or music player apps. There is no additional interaction between the smartphone and the vehicle, particularly active access to vehicle data. The type of additional data processing is determined by the provider of the app being used. Which settings you can make, if any, depends on the specific app and the operat- ing system of your smartphone. \n\nOnline services \n\nWireless network connection If your vehicle has a wireless network connection, data can be exchanged between your vehicle and other systems. The wireless network connection is made possible by the vehicle's own transmitter and receiver or by a mobile end device that you have brought into the vehicle, forexample, a smart- phone. Online functions can be used via this wire- less network connection. This includes online serv- ices and applications/apps provided to you by the manufacturer or by other providers. \n\nR Address book data for use in an integrated \n\nhands-free system or an integrated navigation system \n\nR Entered navigation destinations R Data on the use of Internet services \n\nThese data for convenience and infotainment func- tions may be saved locally in the vehicle or they may be located on a device which you have con- nected to the vehicle, suchas a smartphone, USB flash drive or MP3 player. If you have entered these data yourself, you can delete them at any time. These data are transmitted from the vehicle to third parties only at your request. This applies, in particular, when you use online services in accord- ance with the settings that you have selected. \n\nSmartphone integration (e.g. Android Auto or Apple CarPlay®) If your vehicle is equipped appropriately, you can connect your smartphone or another mobile end device to the vehicle. You can then control them by means of the control elements integrated in the vehicle. The smartphone's picture and sound can be output via the multimedia system. Simultane- ously, specific items of information are transferred to your smartphone. Depending on the type of integration, thisincludes position data, day/night mode and other general vehicle statuses. For more \n\nManufacturer's own services Regarding the manufacturer's online services, the individual functions are described by the manufac- turer in a suitable place, forexample, in the Opera- tor's Manual or on the manufacturer's website, where the relevant data protection information is also given. Personal identification data may be used to provide online services. Data is exchanged via a secure connection, e.g. the manufacturer's designated IT systems. Any personal data which are collected, processed and used, other than for the provision of services, is done so exclusively on the basis of legal permission. This is the case, forexample, for a legally prescribed emergency call system, a contractual agreement or when consent has been given. You can have services and functions, some of which are subject to a fee, activated or deactiva- ted. This excludes legally prescribed functions and services, suchas an emergency call system. \n\nServices of third parties If you use online services from other providers (third parties), these services are the responsibility of the provider in question and subject to that pro- vider's data protection conditions and terms of use. As a general rule, the manufacturer has no influence on the content exchanged. \n\nGeneral notes \n\n31 \n\nFor this reason, when services are provided by third parties, please ask the service provider in question for information about the type, extent and purpose of the collection and use of personal data. \n\nOnboard Logic Unit (OLU) The Onboard Logic Unit (OLU) is available to com- mercial customers. It contains control units, including antennas for connection via wireless networks, that permit the exchange of data between your vehicle and other systems. The control units can be used in conjunc- tion with service provided by a third party. Under certaincircumstances, these services may alter the basic configuration of the vehicle and could affect the performance of certain vehicle functions. For further information about specific services, read the Operator's Manual of the third-party pro- vider. For further information about the Onboard Logic Unit, consult an authorized Mercedes-Benz Center. If you, yourself, do not own and are not responsi- ble for the vehicle, you may notknow the current status of the Onboard Logic Unit. For further infor- mation concerning the services which are cur- rently active, including any data which may be being processed as defined by the GDPR, please contact the person responsible for the vehicle. \n\nData protection rights \n\nDepending on the country, the equipment and functions of your vehicle, and the services and service offerings used, you are entitled to different data protection rights. Further information on data protection and your data protection rights can either be found on the manufacturer's website or you will receive this information as part of the vari- ous services and service offers. There, you will also find the contact information for the manufac- turer and its data protection officer. At a workshop, for example, with the support of a specialist and possibly for a fee, you can have data read out which is stored only locally in the vehicle. \n\nEvent Data Recorders \n\nUSA only:  This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situa- tions, such as an air bag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understand- ing how a vehicle's systems performed. The EDR is \n\ndesigned to record data related to vehicle dynam- ics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as: R How various systems in your vehicle were oper- \n\nating; \n\nR Whether or not the driver and passenger safety \n\nbelts were buckled/fastened; \n\nR How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the \n\naccelerator and/or brake pedal; and, \n\nR How fast the vehicle was traveling. \n\nThese data can help provide a better understand- ing of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data (e.g. name, gender, age and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties such as law enforcement could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation. Access to the vehicle and/or the EDR is needed to read data that is recorded by an EDR, and special equipment is required. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties that have the special equipment, such as law enforcement, can read the information by accessing the vehicle or the EDR. EDR data may be used in civil and criminal matters as a tool in accident reconstruction, accident claims and vehicle safety. Since the Crash Data Retrieval CDR tool that is used to extract data from the EDR is commercially available, Daimler Vans USA, LLC (\"DVUSA\") expressly disclaims any and all liability arising from the extraction of this infor- mation by unauthorized Mercedes-Benz personnel. DVUSA will not share EDR data with others without the consent of the vehicle owners or, if the vehicle is leased, without the consent of the lessee.

In the event of an accident, the restraint system can also reduce the forces to which the vehicle occu- pants are subjected. Only a seat belt which is worn correctly can pro- vide the intended level of protection. Depending on the detected accident situation, Emergency Ten- sioning Devices and/or air bags supplement the protection offered by a correctly worn seat belt. Emergency Tensioning Devices and/or air bags are not deployed in every accident. Vehicles with a co-driver bench seat: the Emer- gency Tensioning Device on the co-driver seat is triggered whether or not the seat belt tongue is engaged in the seat belt buckle. In order for the restraint system to provide the intended level of protection, each vehicle occupant must observe the following information: R Fasten seat belts correctly. R Sit in an almost upright seat position with their \n\nback against the seat backrest. \n\nR Sit with their feet resting on the floor, if possi- \n\nble. \n\n# Never tamper with the wiring or any elec- tronic component parts or their software. \n\nIf it is necessary to adjust the vehicle to accommo- date a person with disabilities, contact an author- ized Mercedes-Benz Center for details. USA only: contact our Customer Assistance Center at 1‑877‑762‑8267. \n\nRestraint system functionality \n\nWhen the vehicle is switched on, a self-test is per- formed, during which the 6 restraint system warning lamp lights up. It goes out no later than a few seconds after the vehicle is started. The com- ponents of the restraint system are then func- tional. \n\nRestraint system malfunction \n\nA malfunction has occurred in the restraint system in the following cases: R The 6 restraint system warning lamp does not light up when the vehicle is switched on. R The 6 restraint system warning lamp lights up continuously or repeatedly during a journey. \n\nR Always secure persons under 5 ft (1.50 m) tall in an additional restraint system suitable for this vehicle. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury due to malfunc- \n\ntions in the restraint system \n\nHowever, no system available today can completely eliminate injuries and fatalities in every accident situation. In particular, the seat belt and air bag generally do not protect against objects penetrat- ing the vehicle from the outside. It is also not pos- sible to completely rule out the risk of injury caused by the air bag deploying. \n\nComponents in the restraint system may be activated unintentionally or not deploy as plan- ned in an accident. # Have the restraint system checked and repaired immediately at a qualified spe- cialist workshop. \n\n34 \n\nOccupant safety \n\nFunction of the restraint system in an accident \n\n# Have a deployed air bag replaced at a \n\nHow the restraint system works is determined by the severity of the impact detected and the type of accident anticipated: R frontal impact R Rear impact R side impact R Overturning or rollover \n\nThe activation thresholds for the components of the restraint system are determined based on the evaluation of the sensor values measured at vari- ous points in the vehicle. This process is pre-emp- tive in nature. The triggering/deployment of the components of the restraint system should take place in good time at the start of the collision. Factors that can be seen and measured only after a collision has occurred cannot play a decisive role in air bag deployment, nor do they provide an indi- cation of air bag deployment. The vehicle may be deformed significantly without an air bag being deployed. This is the case if only parts which are relatively easily deformed are affected and the rate of vehicle deceleration is not high. Conversely, an air bag may be deployed even though the vehicle suffers only minor deformation. If very rigid vehicle parts, such as longitudinal members, are hit, the vehicle deceleration may be high enough for this to happen. Depending on the detected deployment situation, the components of the restraint system can be activated or deployed independently of each other: R Emergency Tensioning Device: frontal impact, rear impact, side impact1), overturning, rollover \n\nR Driver's air bag, co-driver air bag: frontal \n\nimpact \n\nqualified specialist workshop as soon as possible. \n\nFor your safety and that of your passengers, it is recommended that you have the vehicle towed to a qualified specialist workshop after an accident. Take this into account, particularly if a Emergency Tensioning Device is triggered or an air bag is deployed. If the Emergency Tensioning Devices are triggered or an air bag is deployed, you will hear a bang, and a small amount of powder may also be released: R the bang will not generally affect your hearing. R in general, the powder released is not hazard- \n\nous to health but may cause short-term breath- ing difficulties to persons suffering from asthma or other pulmonary conditions. Provided it is safe to do so, leave the vehicle immediately or open the window in order to prevent breathing difficulties. \n\nAir bags and pyrotechnic Emergency Tensioning Devices contain perchlorate material, which may require special handling or environmental protec- tion measures. National guidelines regarding waste disposal must be observed. In California see https://dtsc.ca.gov/. Using the search function, you will find information on perchlorate, for exam- ple. \n\nSeat belts \n\nProtection provided by the seat belt \n\nAlways fasten your seat belt correctly before start- ing a journey. Only a seat belt which is worn cor- rectly can provide the intended level of protection. \n\nR Side impact air bag: side impact R Window curtain air bag: side impact, overturn- \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to \n\nincorrectly fastened seat belt \n\ning, rollover, frontal impact \n\n1) Only when the vehicle is fitted with a side impact air bag or window curtain air bag. \n\n& WARNING Risk of burns from hot air bag \n\ncomponents \n\nThe air bag parts are hot after an air bag has been deployed. # Do not touch the air bag parts. \n\nIf the seat belt is not worn correctly, it cannot perform its intended protective function. In addition, an incorrectly fastened seat belt can also cause injuries, for example, in the event of an accident or when braking or chang- ing direction suddenly. # Always ensure that all vehicle occupants have their seat belts fastened correctly and are sitting properly. \n\nOccupant safety \n\n35 \n\nAlways observe the instructions about the correct driver's seat position and adjusting the seat (/ page 67). In order for the correctly worn seat belt to provide the intended level of protection, each vehicle occu- pant must observe the following information: R The seat belt must not be twisted and must fit \n\ntightly and snugly across the body. \n\nR The seat belt must be routed across the center of the shoulder and as low down across the hips as possible. \n\nLimitations of the protection provided by the seat belt \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to an \n\nincorrect seat position \n\nThe seat belt does not offer the intended level of protection if you have not moved the seat backrest to an almost vertical position. In particular, you could slip beneath the seat- belt and become injured. # Adjust the seat properly before beginning \n\nR The shoulder section of the seat belt should \n\nyour journey. \n\nnot touch your neck nor be routed under your arm or behind your back. \n\nR Avoid wearing bulky clothing, e.g. a winter \n\ncoat. \n\n# Always ensure that the seat backrest is in an almost vertical position and that the shoulder belt is routed across the center of your shoulder. \n\nR Push the lap belt down as far as possible \n\nacross your hips and pull tight with the shoul- der section of the belt. Never route the lap belt across your abdomen. Pregnant women must also take particular care with this. \n\nR Never route the seat belt across sharp, poin- \n\nted, abrasive or fragile objects. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or death when \n\nadditional restraint systems are not used for persons with a smaller stature \n\nPersons under 5 ft (1.50 m ) tall cannot wear the seat belt correctly without a suitable addi- tional restraint system. # Always secure persons under 5 ft \n\nR Only one person should use each seat belt at \n\nany one time. \n\n(1.50 m) tall in a suitable restraint sys- tem. \n\nR Never secure objects with a seat belt if the \n\nseat belt is being used by one of the vehicle's occupants. Also ensure that no objects, e.g. a cushion, are ever placed between a person and the seat. \n\nThe seat belts on the following seats are equipped with a child seat safety feature: R Co-driver seat R Rear seats \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to damaged or modified seat belts \n\nSeat belts cannot provide protection in the fol- lowing situations: R The seat belt is damaged, has been modi- fied, is extremely dirty, bleached or dyed \n\nR The seat belt buckle is damaged or \n\nextremely dirty \n\nR Modifications have been made to the \n\nActivate or deactivate the child seat safety feature of the seat belt (/ page 42). If children are traveling in the vehicle, always observe the instructions and safety notes on \"Chil- dren in the vehicle\" (/ page 40). Always observe the instructions for loading the vehicle when securing objects, luggage or loads (/ page 208). \n\nEmergency Tensioning Device, seat belt anchorage or seat belt retractor \n\nSeat belts may sustain non-visible damage in an accident, e.g. due to glass splinters. Modified or damaged seat belts could tear or fail in the event of an accident, for example. Modified Emergency Tensioning Devices could accidentally trigger or fail to function as inten- ded. # Never modify the seat belt system, for example the seat belt, seat belt buckle, \n\n36 \n\nOccupant safety \n\nEmergency Tensioning Device, seat belt anchorage and seat belt retractor. \n\n# Make sure that the seat belts are undam- \n\naged, not worn and clean. \n\n# Always have the seat belts checked \n\nimmediately after an accident at a quali- fied specialist workshop. \n\nOnly use seat belts that are approved by the dealer specified in the publication details for your vehicle. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or death from \n\ndeployed pyrotechnic Emergency Tension- ing Devices \n\nPyrotechnic Emergency Tensioning Devices that have been deployed are no longer opera- tional and are unable to perform their intended protective function. # Therefore, have deployed pyrotechnic \n\nEmergency Tensioning Devices immedi- ately replaced at a qualified specialist workshop. \n\nFor your safety and that of your passengers, it is recommended that you have the vehicle towed to a qualified specialist workshop after an accident. \n\n* NOTE Damage caused by trapping the seat \n\nbelt \n\n# Always engage seat belt tongue 1 of the seat belt into seat belt buckle 2 of the corre- sponding seat. \n\n# To adjust the seat belt height: press button 3 on the seat belt outlet and slide the seat belt outlet to the desired position. \n\n# To engage the seat belt outlet: release button 3 and ensure that the seat belt outlet engages. \n\n% Only a seat belt which is worn correctly can provide the intended level of protection. Observe the notes on fastening the seatbelt (/ page 34). \n\nIf an unused seat belt is not fully retracted, it may become trapped in the door or in the seat mechanism. # Always ensure that an unused seat belt is \n\nfully retracted. \n\nFastening and adjusting seat belts \n\nIf the seat belt is pulled quickly or sharply, the seat belt retractor locks. The seat belt strap cannot be pulled out any further. \n\n* NOTE Deployment of components of the \n\nrestraint system when the front passenger seat is unoccupied and a seat belt is buck- led \n\nWhen the front passenger seat is unoccupied and the seat belt tongue of the seat belt is engaged in the seat belt buckle, components of the restraint system may deploy unnecessa- rily on the front passenger side, e.g. the Emer- gency Tensioning Device. # Only buckle the seat belts as intended. \n\n% Observe the notes on stowage areas \n\n(/ page 208). Information on installing a child restraint sys- tem and on children traveling in the vehicle can be found in the \"Children in the vehicle\" section (/ page 42). \n\nOccupant safety \n\n37 \n\nReleasing the seat belts \n\n# Press the release button in the seat belt buckle and guide the seat belt back with the seat belt tongue. \n\nPossible protection per air bag: R Driver's air bag, co-driver air bag: head and rib- \n\ncage \n\nR Window curtain air bag: head R Side impact air bag: ribcage and pelvis \n\nFunction of the seat belt warning system for driver and co-driver \n\nThe ü seat belt warning lamp in the Instrument Display is a reminder that all vehicle occupants must wear their seat belts correctly. The ü seat belt warning lamp lights up for six seconds each time the vehicle is switched on. A warning tone may also sound. After the vehicle is started, the seat belt warning goes out as soon as the driver's and the co-driver's seat belts are fastened. While driving, the seat belt warning lights up in the following cases: R if the vehicle's speed is higher than 15 mph \n\n(25 km/h) and the driver's or co-driver's seat belt is not fastened \n\nR if the driver or co-driver unfasten their seat belt \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or fatal injuries if the front passenger air bag is enabled \n\nIf the front passenger air bag is enabled, a child on the front passenger seat may be struck by the front passenger air bag in the event of an accident. # NEVER use a rearward-facing child \n\nrestraint system on a seat with an ENA- BLED FRONT AIR BAG. This can result in the DEATH of or SERIOUS INJURY to the CHILD. \n\nWhen installing a child restraint system on the co- driver seat, observe the vehicle-specific informa- tion (/ page 45). Also be sure to observe the notes on rearward-facing or forward-facing child restraint systems on the co-driver seat (/ page 45). \n\nduring the journey \n\nProtection provided by the airbags \n\nAirbags \n\nOverview of air bags \n\nDepending on the accident situation, an airbag may supplement the protection offered by a cor- rectly fastened seat belt. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to an \n\nincorrect seat position \n\n1 Driver's air bag 2 Window curtain air bag 3 Co-driver air bag 4 Side impact air bag \n\nThe installation location of an air bag is identified by the AIRBAG symbol. When enabled, an air bag can provide additional protection for the respective vehicle occupant. \n\nIf you deviate from the correct seat position, the airbag cannot perform its intended protec- tive function. Each vehicle occupant must make sure of the following: R Fasten seat belts correctly. Pregnant \n\nwomen must take particular care to ensure that the lap belt never lies across the abdo- men. \n\nR Adopt the correct seat position and keep as far away as possible from the airbags. \n\nR Observe the following information. \n\n# Always make sure that there are no \n\nobjects between the airbag and vehicle occupant. \n\n38 \n\nOccupant safety \n\nTo avoid the risks resulting from the deployment of an airbag, each vehicle occupant must observe the following information in particular: R Before starting your journey, adjust your seat correctly; both the driver's and co-driver seat should be moved as far back as possible. When doing so, always observe the information on the correct driver's seat position (/ page 67). \n\nLimitations of the protection provided by air bags \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury due to modifica- \n\ntions to the cover of an airbag \n\nIf you change the cover of an airbag or attach objects, e.g. even stickers, to it, the airbag may no longer function as intended. # Never modify the cover of an airbag. # Do not attach any objects to the cover. \n\nR Only hold the steering wheel by the steering wheel rim. This allows the airbag to be fully deployed. \n\nR Always lean against the seat backrest when \n\nthe vehicle is in motion. Do not lean forwards or against the door or side window. You may otherwise be in the deployment area of the air- bags. \n\nThe installation location of an air bag is identified by the AIRBAG symbol (/ page 37). Objects in the deployment area of an air bag may prevent the air bag from functioning correctly. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury from objects in the deployment area of an airbag \n\nR Always keep your feet on the floor. Do not put your feet on the cockpit, for example. Your feet may otherwise be in the deployment area of the airbag. \n\nR If children are traveling in the vehicle, observe \n\nthe additional notes (/ page 40). \n\nR Always stow and secure objects correctly. \n\nObjects in the vehicle interior may prevent an air- bag from functioning correctly. Each vehicle occu- pant must always make sure of the following in particular: R There are no people, animals or objects \n\nbetween the vehicle occupants and an airbag. \n\nObjects in the deployment area of an airbag can hinder or prevent the correct deployment of the airbag. The airbag may then deploy in an uncontrolled manner and may even cause additional injuries to the vehicle occupants by deploying. This may be the case in particular if the airbag is integrated into the seat. # Always stow and secure objects cor- \n\nrectly. \n\n# Before commencing your journey, make sure that no objects are stowed in the deployment area of an airbag. \n\nR There are no objects between the seat, door \n\nand door pillar (B-pillar). \n\nR There are no hard objects, e.g. coat hangers, hanging on the grab handles or coat hooks. R There are no accessories, such as mobile navi- gation devices, mobile phones or cup holders, within the deployment area of an airbag, e.g. on the cockpit, on the door, on the side win- dow or on the side trim. In addition, no connecting cables, tensioning straps or retaining straps must be routed or attached to the vehicle within the deployment area of an airbag. Always comply with the accessory manufacturer's installation instruc- tions and, in particular, the notes on suitable places for installation. \n\nR There are no heavy, sharp-edged or fragile \n\nobjects in the pockets of your clothing. Store such objects in a suitable place. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to the use of unsuitable seat covers \n\nIf you use unsuitable seat covers, the airbags cannot protect vehicle occupants as they are designed to do. # Only use seat covers that are approved by the sales organization responsible for your vehicle. \n\nYou can find information on the sales organization for your vehicle in the publication details for this Operator's Manual. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury due to malfunc- \n\ntioning sensors in the door \n\nThe function of the airbags can be impaired due to modifications or incorrect work per- formed on the doors or door trim, or if the doors are damaged. \n\nOccupant safety \n\n39 \n\n# Never modify the doors or parts of the \n\ndoors. \n\n# Always have work on the doors or door trim carried out at a qualified specialist workshop. \n\nThe driver can cancel automatic braking by taking the following actions: R braking more strongly than automatic braking R fully depressing the accelerator pedal with \n\nforce \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury due to deployed \n\nairbag \n\nSafely transporting children in the vehicle \n\nA deployed airbag no longer offers any protec- tion. # Have the vehicle towed to a qualified \n\nspecialist workshop in order to have the deployed airbag replaced. \n\nHave deployed air bags replaced immediately. \n\nAlways observe when children are traveling in the vehicle \n\n% Always observe the safety notes relevant to the situation. In doing so, you will be able to identify possible risks and avoid dangers when children are traveling in the vehicle (/ page 40). \n\nAutomatic measures after an accident \n\nDepending on the type and severity of the acci- dent, and depending on the vehicle's equipment, the following measures can be implemented, for example: R automatic braking (post-collision brake) R activating the hazard warning lights R triggering an automatic emergency call \n\n(/ page 227) R switching off engine \n\nTo start the vehicle again, switch the vehicle off and on once more (/ page 110). Depend- ing on the type and severity of the accident, it may possible that the vehicle can no longer be started. \n\nBe diligent Bear in mind that negligence when securing a child in the child restraint system may have serious con- sequences. Always be diligent and secure a child carefully before each journey. Infants and children must never travel sitting on the lap of a vehicle occupant. To improve protection for children younger than 12 years old or under 5 ft (1.50 m) in height, Mercedes-Benz recommends you always observe the following notes: R Always secure the child in a child restraint sys- tem suitable for this Mercedes-Benz vehicle. R The child restraint system must be appropriate \n\nto the age, weight and size of the child. \n\nR The vehicle seat must be suitable for installing \n\na child restraint system. \n\nR switching off the fuel supply R unlocking the vehicle doors R lowering the front side windows R switching on the interior lighting \n\nAccident statistics show that children secured on the rear seats are generally safer than children secured on the front seats. For this reason Mercedes-Benz strongly advises you to install a child restraint system on a rear seat. \n\nFunction of the post-collision brake Depending on the accident situation, the post-col- lision brake can minimize the severity of a further collision or even avoid it. If an accident has been detected, the post-collision brake can implement automatic braking. When the vehicle has come to a standstill, the electric park- ing brake is automatically applied. \n\nThe generic term child restraint system \n\nThe generic term child restraint system is used in this Operator's Manual. A child restraint system is, for example: R a baby car seat R a rearward-facing child seat R a forward-facing child seat R a child booster seat with a backrest and seat \n\nbelt guides \n\nThe child restraint system must be appropriate to the age, weight and size of the child. \n\n40 \n\nOccupant safety \n\nObserve laws and regulations Always observe the legal requirements when using a child restraint system in the vehicle. \n\nObserve standards for child restraint systems \n\nBabies and small children have comparatively weak neck muscles in relation to the size and weight of their head. The risk of injury to the cervi- cal spine during an accident can be reduced in a rearward-facing child restraint system. \n\nAll child restraint systems must meet the following standards: R U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards \n\n213 and 225 \n\nR Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 213 \n\nAlways secure a child restraint system correctly \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to \n\nincorrect installation of the child restraint system \n\nand 210.2 \n\nConfirmation that the child restraint system com- plies with the standards can be found on an instruction label on the child restraint system. This confirmation can also be found in the installation instructions that are included with the child restraint system. \n\nThe child can then not be protected or restrained as intended. # Be sure to comply with the manufactur- er's installation instructions for the child restraint system and its correct use. # Make sure that the entire base of the \n\nchild restraint system always rests on the sitting surface of the seat. \n\nDetecting risks, avoiding danger \n\n# Never place objects (e.g. cushions) \n\nSecuring systems for child restraint systems in the vehicle \n\nOnly use the following securing systems for child restraint systems: R the ISOFIX securing rings R the seat belt system of the vehicle R the Top Tether anchorages \n\nInstalling an ISOFIX child restraint system is prefer- red. Simply attaching to the securing rings on the vehi- cle can reduce the risk of installing the child restraint system incorrectly. When securing a child with the integrated seat belt of the ISOFIX child restraint system, always comply with the permissible gross weight for the child and child restraint system (/ page 42). A booster seat may be necessary to achieve proper seat belt positioning for children over 40 lbs (18 kg) in weight or until they reach a height where a three-point seat belt can be installed properly without a booster seat. Mercedes-Benz recommends a child booster seat with a backrest and seat belt guides. \n\nAdvantage of a rearward-facing child restraint sys- tem It is preferable to transport a baby or a small child in a suitable rearward-facing child restraint sys- tem. In this case, the child sits in the opposite direction to the direction of travel and faces back- wards. \n\nunder or behind the child restraint sys- tem. \n\n# Use child restraint systems only with the \n\noriginal cover designed for them. # Always replace damaged covers with \n\ngenuine covers. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to unsecured child restraint systems in the vehicle \n\nIf the child restraint system is incorrectly mounted or unsecured, it may come loose. The child can then not be protected or restrained as intended. Unused child restraint systems could be flung around and hit vehicle occupants. # Always comply with the manufacturer's installation instructions for the child restraint system and its correct use. # Always fit child restraint systems cor- \n\nrectly, even if they are transported in the vehicle unused. \n\nR Always observe the child restraint system man- ufacturer's installation and operating instruc- \n\nOccupant safety \n\n41 \n\ntions as well as the vehicle-specific informa- tion: \n\nAvoid direct sunlight \n\n- \n- \n- \n\nInstalling the ISOFIX child restraint system on the rear seat (/ page 42).

Children could suffer burns from these parts, particularly the metallic parts of the child restraint system. # Always make sure that the child restraint system is not exposed to direct sunlight. \n\nR Observe the warning labels in the vehicle inte- \n\n# Cover the child restraint system with a \n\nrior and on the child restraint system. \n\nblanket, for example. \n\nR Also secure Top Tether if present. \n\nDo not modify the child restraint system \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury due to modifica- tions to the child restraint system \n\n# If the child restraint system has been exposed to direct sunlight, allow it to cool before securing a child into it. # Never leave children unattended in the \n\nvehicle. \n\nThe child restraint system can no longer func- tion properly. This poses an increased risk of injury. # Never modify a child restraint system. # Only affix accessories which have been \n\nspecially approved for this child restraint system by the child restraint system's manufacturer. \n\nObserve when stopping or parking \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident and injury due \n\nto children left unattended in the vehicle \n\nIf children are left unsupervised in the vehicle, they could, in particular: R open doors, thereby endangering other \n\npersons or road users. \n\nOnly use child restraint systems which are in proper working condition \n\nR get out and be struck by oncoming traffic. R operate vehicle equipment and become \n\ntrapped, for example. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury or death caused by the use of damaged child restraint sys- tems \n\nChild restraint systems or their retaining sys- tems that have been subjected to stress in an accident may not be able to perform their intended protective function. It may be the case that the child cannot be properly restrained. # Always immediately replace child \n\nrestraint systems that have been dam- aged or involved in an accident. \n\n# Have the securing systems for the child restraint systems checked at a qualified specialist workshop before installing a child restraint system again. \n\nIn addition, the children could also set the vehicle in motion, for example by: R releasing the parking brake. R changing the transmission position. R starting the vehicle. \n\n# Never leave children unattended in the \n\nvehicle. \n\n# When leaving the vehicle, always take the SmartKey with you and lock the vehicle. # Keep the vehicle SmartKey out of reach \n\nof children. \n\n42 \n\nOccupant safety \n\nOverview of suitable seats in the vehicle for instal- ling a child restraint system \n\nLeft/right rear seat \n\nPreferred securing system: ® ISOFIX child seat anchor (/ page 42) ¯ Also secure Top Tether if present \n\n(/ page 43) \n\nInstalling a child restraint system # When installing a child restraint system, always observe the manufacturer's installation and operating instructions for the child restraint system used, as well as the notes in this Oper- ator's Manual. \n\n# Pull the seat belt smoothly from the seat belt \n\noutlet. \n\nAlternative securing system: 7 Seat belt on vehicle seat \n\nCo-driver seat \n\n# Engage the seat belt tongue in the seat belt \n\nbuckle. \n\nActivating the special seatbelt retractor # Extend the seat belt fully and then allow the \n\nSecuring system: 7 Seat belt on vehicle seat \n\nRear center seat \n\nSecuring system: 7 Seat belt on vehicle seat ¯ Also secure Top Tether if present \n\n(/ page 43) \n\ninertia reel to retract the belt.

This uses a camera on top of the roof at the rear to provide a better view to the rear. The inside rearview mirror can be used either as a standard inside rearview mirror or as a display. To prevent glare from the digital inside rearview mirror, first set the digital inside rearview mirror as the standard inside rearview mirror. \n\nIf you fold or unfold the electric outside mirrors by hand, you may damage the outside mirrors and the outside mirrors will not engage prop- erly. If the outside mirrors are not folded in when the vehicle is washed in an automatic car wash, the brushes may forcibly fold in and damage the outside mirrors. \n\nLight and vision \n\n99 \n\nDigital image noise may occur on the display under certain circumstances in unfavorable ambient light. Certain types of sunlight, e.g. sun low on the hori- zon or light from another intense light source, can reduce the display's contrast and cause it to become too bright. In such situations, objects on the display may be obscured or difficult to see. In these cases, be particularly careful and adapt your driving style accordingly. Drivers must always wear the necessary personal visual aids required for them to drive a vehicle. Drivers with presbyopia (age-related long-sighted- ness) should, if necessary, wear visual aids with multifocal lenses to be sufficiently able to see traf- fic including via the displays. % If the camera on top of the roof at the rear is dirty, the image may be impaired. In this case, clean the camera manually with a damp cloth. Observe the notes on cleaning the digital inside rearview mirror (/ page 224). # To use the standard inside rearview mirror:  \n\n# To activate, put the vehicle in reverse gear or \n\npress button 5. \n\n# To deactivate, take the vehicle out of reverse \n\ngear or press button 5 again. \n\nError mode of the digital inside rearview mirror If a system error occurs, e.g. if the camera fails, a crossed-out camera will appear at the top left of the display and no camera image will be visible in the mirror. # Switch to the standard inside rearview mirror if \n\nthere is a system error. \n\nIf the vehicle is equipped with a rear view camera with image in the inside rearview mirror and a sys- tem error occurs, a crossed out camera with the number 2 will appear on the left side of the display. In this case, no camera image is available for maneuvering. \n\nSetting anti-glare mode for the inside rearview mir- ror \n\nmove the switch to position 1. \n\n# To use the display: move the switch to position \n\n2. \n\nAdjusting the display brightness % The digital inside rearview mirror is equipped with light sensors on the front and back and automatically adjusts the brightness of the dis- play to the ambient light. Do not cover the light sensors, e.g. with a sticker. \n\n# Press menu button 3 once. # Press button 4 to reduce the display bright- \n\nness. \n\nor # Press button 5 to increase the display bright- \n\nness. \n\n# Fold anti-glare lever 1 in the direction of the \n\narrow. \n\nAdjusting the angle of the camera # Press menu button 3 twice. # Press button 4 to move the angle down- \n\nwards. \n\nor # Press button 5 to move the angle upwards. \n\nActivating and deactivating the rear view camera image The vehicle may be equipped with a rear view cam- era with image in the inside rearview mirror. \n\n100 Climate control \n\nOverview of climate control systems \n\nHeating system overview \n\n1 Sets the temperature 2 / Switches the rear passenger compart- \n\nment heating on/off \n\n3 ¤ Switches the rear window defroster \n\non/off (/ page 105) \n\n4 O Switches footwell air distribution on/off 5 ¬ Switches windshield demisting on/off \n\n(/ page 104) \n\n6 Vehicles with stationary heater or heater boos- ter: & switches the stationary heater or heater booster on/off (/ page 107) \n\n7 Sets the airflow % The indicator lamps on the buttons signal that the function in question has been activated. \n\nClimate control 101 \n\nTEMPMATIC overview \n\n1 w Sets the temperature 2 Display 3 K Sets the airflow 4 Î Vehicles with windshield heaters: switches the windshield heater on/off (/ page 105) \n\n5 Vehicles with stationary heaters or booster \n\nheaters: & switches the stationary heater or booster heater on/off (/ page 107) 6 Vehicles with a rear window defroster: ¤ switches the rear window defroster on/off (/ page 105) \n\n7 h Switches air-recirculation mode on/off \n\n(/ page 104) \n\n8 ¬ Switches windshield demisting on/off \n\n(/ page 104) \n\n9 _ Sets the air distribution (/ page 104) A ¿ Switches the A/C function on/off \n\n(/ page 103) \n\nB / Vehicles with dual-zone climate control systems: adjusts the rear passenger compart- ment climate control/heating (indicator lamp flashes) (/ page 103) \n\n% The indicator lamps on the buttons signal that the function in question has been activated. \n\n102 Climate control \n\n3-zone automatic climate control overview \n\n1 w Sets the temperature 2 Display 3 K Sets the airflow 4 Î Vehicles with windshield heater: switches the windshield heater on/off (/ page 105) \n\n5 Vehicles with stationary heaters or booster \n\nheaters: & switches the stationary heater or booster heater on/off (/ page 107) 6 Vehicles with a rear window heater: ¤ switches the rear window heater on/off (/ page 105) \n\n7 h Switches air-recirculation mode on/off \n\n(/ page 104) \n\n8 ¬ Switches windshield defrosting on/off \n\n(/ page 104) \n\n9 _ Sets the air distribution (/ page 104) A ¿ Switches the A/C function on/off \n\n(/ page 103) \n\nB Ã Sets climate control to automatic mode, front (/ page 103) and rear (/ page 103) C 0 Activates/deactivates synchronization \n\nOperating climate control systems \n\nSwitching the climate control system on/off \n\n# To switch on: set the airflow to 1 or higher on \n\nthe front-compartment menu. \n\n# To switch off: set the airflow to 0 or OFF on the \n\nfront-compartment menu.

The auxiliary heating automati- cally adapts its operating mode to the outside tem- perature and weather. It is therefore possible that the auxiliary heating may switch from ventilation to heating mode or from heating to ventilation mode. When the engine is running, auxiliary ventilation is not active. Auxiliary heating automatically switches itself off after a maximum of 50 minutes. You can- not use the \"auxiliary ventilation\" operating mode to cool the air inside the vehicle to below the out- side temperature. Auxiliary heating helps to heat up the vehicle while the engine is running and at low outside temperatures. Operating the hot-water auxiliary heater draws power from the vehicle battery. Therefore, drive a reasonably long distance after heating or ventilat- ing the vehicle twice in succession at most. Auxiliary heating can be activated only at tempera- tures below 40 °F (4.5 °C). \n\n▌Switching the hot-water auxiliary heater on/off with the button \n\n% Vehicles with a modified fuel display: if an \n\nexternally operated consumer is connected via the cable for the auxiliary heating, this is not taken into consideration on the \"remaining range\" display of the on-board computer. In this case, observe the fuel display. The fuel display reflects the actual fill level. \n\nIf you are transporting hazardous materials, com- ply with the relevant safety regulations. Place objects a sufficient distance from the auxiliary heating outlet opening. Auxiliary heating works independently of the engine and complements the climate control sys- tem in the vehicle. Auxiliary heating heats the air inside the vehicle to the set temperature. \n\nRequirements:  R The fuel tank is filled above the reserve level. \n\n# To switch the auxiliary heating on and off:  \n\npress the & button. \n\n# To activate the specified temperature: switch on the vehicle and press the & button. # To deactivate the specified temperature: press \n\nthe & button. \n\n# To set the specified temperature: set the tem- perature using the w button and press the & button. \n\nColors of the indicator lamp: R Blue: stationary ventilation has been switched \n\non. \n\nR Red: the stationary heater has been switched \n\nHot-water auxiliary heater \n\non. \n\n▌Function of the hot-water auxiliary heater The hot-water auxiliary heater complements your vehicle's climate control system, and has a heater booster, auxiliary heating and auxiliary ventilation function. In addition, the auxiliary heating system heats the engine coolant to protect the engine and save fuel during the warming-up phase. The auxili- ary heating heats the air inside the vehicle to the set temperature. It is not dependent on the heat output of the running engine. The auxiliary heating is operated directly using the vehicle's fuel. For this reason, the fuel tank must have been filled above the reserve fuel level so that the auxiliary \n\nR Yellow: a departure time has been preselected. \n\nThe stationary heater or stationary ventilation switches off after a maximum of 50 minutes. # To activate the heater booster mode: switch on \n\nthe vehicle and press the & button. # To switch off heater booster mode: press \n\nthe & button. \n\n108 Climate control \n\n▌Setting the hot-water auxiliary heater using the on-board computer \n\nRequirements:  R The fuel tank is filled above the reserve level.

R Shifting to the next highest gear at the very lat- est when the needle reaches the last third before the red area in the tachometer. \n\n▌Notes on driving \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to objects \n\nin the driver's footwell \n\nObjects in the driver's footwell may impede pedal travel or block a depressed pedal. This jeopardizes the operating and road safety of the vehicle. # Stow all objects securely in the vehicle so that they do not get into the driver's footwell. \n\n# When using floor mats or carpets, make sure that they are properly secured so that they do not slip or obstruct the ped- als. \n\n# Do not lay multiple floor mats or carpets \n\non top of one another. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to incor- \n\nrect footwear \n\nR Avoiding stress on the vehicle such as driving \n\nat full throttle. \n\nR Not shifting manually to a lower gear to brake. R After 1,000 miles (1,500 km), gradually \n\nincreasing the engine speed and accelerating the vehicle up to full speed. \n\nR Vehicles with automatic transmission: not \n\ndepressing the accelerator pedal beyond the pressure point (kickdown). \n\nIncorrect footwear includes, for example: R Shoes with platform soles R Shoes with high heels R Slippers \n\nThere is a risk of an accident. # Always wear suitable footwear so that you can operate the pedals safely. \n\nThis also applies if the engine or parts of the drive- train have been replaced. Also observe the following breaking-in notes: R After the vehicle has been delivered or after \n\nrepairs, the sensor system of the ESP® driving safety system adjusts itself automatically after the vehicle has been driven a certain distance. Full system effectiveness is not reached until the end of this teach-in process. \n\nR New or exchanged brakepads, brake discs and tires only provide optimal braking and bonding after several hundred kilometers. Until then, compensate for the reduced braking effect by applying greater pressure to the brake pedal. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident if the vehicle is \n\nswitched off while driving \n\nIf you switch off the vehicle while driving, safety functions are restricted or no longer available. This may affect the power steering system and the brake force boosting, for example. You will need to use considerably more force to steer and brake, for example. # Do not switch off the vehicle while driv- \n\ning. \n\n& DANGER Risk of death caused by exhaust \n\ngases \n\nCombustion engines emit poisonous exhaust gases such as carbon monoxide. Inhaling these exhaust gases is hazardous to health and leads to poisoning. \n\nDriving and parking 113 \n\n# Never leave the engine or, if present, the auxiliary heating running in an enclosed space without sufficient ventilation. \n\n& DANGER Risk of fatal injury due to poison- \n\nous exhaust gases \n\nIf the tailpipe is blocked or sufficient ventilation is not possible, poisonous exhaust gases such as carbon monoxide may enter the vehicle. This is the case, for example, if the vehicle gets stuck in the snow. # Keep the tailpipe and the area around the vehicle free from snow when the engine or the stationary heater is running. \n\n# Open a window on the side of the vehicle facing away from the wind to ensure an adequate supply of fresh air. \n\nR Observe the legal requirements for the country \n\nin which you are driving. \n\nR While driving, only operate mobile communica- tions equipment when the traffic conditions permit it. You may otherwise be distracted from the traffic conditions, cause an accident and injure yourself and others. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to over- \n\nheated brake system \n\nIf you rest your foot on the brake pedal during while driving, the brake system may overheat. This increases the braking distance and the brake system may even fail. # Never use the brake pedal as a footrest. # Do not press the brake pedal and accel- \n\nerator pedal simultaneously while driving. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident and injury due to being under the influence of alcohol and drugs while driving \n\nDrinking and driving and/or taking drugs and driving are very dangerous combinations. Even a small amount of alcohol or drugs can affect your reflexes, perceptions and judgment. The possibility of a serious or even fatal acci- dent are greatly increased when you drink or take drugs and drive. # Do not drink or take drugs and drive or allow anyone to drive who has been drinking or taking drugs. \n\nOn long and steep downhill gradients, you should change down to a lower gear in good time. Take particular note of this when driving a laden vehicle. By doing so, you will make use of the engine's braking effect. This will take some of the strain off the brake system and prevent the brakes from overheating and wearing too quickly. \n\n* NOTE Wearing out the brake linings by \n\ncontinuously depressing the brake pedal \n\n# Do not depress the brake pedal continu- \n\nously whilst driving. \n\n# To use the braking effect of the engine, shift to a lower gear in good time. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident and injury from \n\noperating mobile communications equip- ment \n\nIf you operate mobile communication equip- ment when driving, you will be distracted from the traffic situation. This could also cause you to lose control of the vehicle. The probability of a serious or even fatal acci- dent increases greatly if you operate mobile communication equipment when driving. # Only operate mobile communication \n\nequipment when the vehicle is stationary. \n\n* NOTE Damage to the drivetrain and engine \n\nwhen pulling away \n\n# Do not warm up the engine while the \n\nvehicle is stationary. Pull away immedi- ately. \n\n# Avoid high engine speeds and driving at full throttle until the engine has reached its operating temperature. \n\n* NOTE Damage to the catalytic converter \n\ndue to non-combusted fuel \n\nFor your own safety, observe the following points when operating mobile communications equip- ment: \n\nThe engine is not running smoothly and is mis- firing. Non-combusted fuel may get into the catalytic converter. \n\n114 Driving and parking \n\n# Only depress the accelerator pedal \n\n▌Notes on the limit speed \n\nslightly. \n\n# Have the cause rectified immediately at a \n\nqualified specialist workshop. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury through exceeding the specified tire load-bearing capacity or the permissible speed rating \n\n* NOTE Damage to the vehicle due to not observing the maximum permitted head- room clearance \n\nIf the vehicle height is greater than the maxi- mum permitted headroom clearance, the roof and other parts of the vehicle may be dam- aged. # Observe the signposted headroom clear- \n\nance. \n\n# If the vehicle height is greater than the permitted headroom clearance, do not enter. \n\n# Observe the changed vehicle height with \n\nadd-on roof equipment. \n\n▌Exhaust emission monitoring Specific engine systems are designed to keep poi- sonous components of exhaust gases within legal limits. These systems only work optimally if they are maintained exactly according to manufacturer's specifications. It is for this reason that all work on the engine should only be performed by qualified and authorized Mercedes-Benz Center technicians. Under no circumstances should engine settings be changed. In addition, all specific maintenance work must be performed at regular intervals and in compliance with the service regulations of the dealer named in the imprint. Refer to the Mainte- nance Booklet for details. \n\n▌Notes on short-distance trips If the vehicle is predominantly used for short-dis- tance driving, fuel may accumulate in the engine oil and cause engine damage. If you mainly drive short distances, you should drive on a freeway or go for a country drive for 20 minutes every 480 km (300 miles). This facilitates the regeneration of the diesel particulate filter. \n\nExceeding the specified tire load rating or the permissible speed rating may lead to tire dam- age and to the tires bursting. # Therefore, only use tire types and sizes approved for your vehicle model. # Observe the tire load rating and speed \n\nrating required for your vehicle. \n\nYou must find out about the maximum permissible speed for the tires (tire and tire pressure). Observe the legal requirements for tires for the country in which you are staying. % Vehicles with tachograph: due to the different certification requirements for the tachograph and instrument cluster, the displayed speeds may differ. Please keep to the speed display in the instrument cluster. \n\nYou can permanently limit the speed of your vehi- cle. Mercedes-Benz recommends a qualified specialist workshop for programming the limit speed. Note that you cannot exceed a programmed limit speed when overtaking. On downhill gradients, the limit speed may be exceeded. Apply the brakes if necessary. Display messages indicate that you are approach- ing the limit speed. % For buses, the speed is limited to 60 mph \n\n(100 km/h) at the factory. When overtaking, bear in mind that the limit speed cannot be exceeded. \n\n▌Information about driving abroad \n\nService An extensive Mercedes-Benz service is also availa- ble abroad. Nevertheless, please remember that services facilities or spare parts may not be availa- ble immediately. The relevant workshop directories are available from an authorized Mercedes-Benz Center. \n\nFuel In some countries, only fuels with an increased sul- fur content are available. \n\nDriving and parking 115 \n\nMercedes-Benz recommends installing a fuel filter with a water separator for countries with an increased water content in diesel. Unsuitable fuel can cause engine damage. Infor- mation about fuel can be found in the \"Fuel\" sec- tion (/ page 276). \n\n▌Information about transport by rail Transporting your vehicle by rail may be subject to certain restrictions or require special measures to be taken in some countries due to varying tunnel heights and loading standards. You can obtain information about this from any authorized Mercedes-Benz Center. \n\n▌Information on brakes \n\n& WARNING Risk of skidding and of an acci- dent due to shifting down on slippery road surfaces \n\nIf you shift down on slippery road surfaces to increase the engine braking effect, the drive wheels may lose traction. # Do not shift down on slippery road surfa- ces to increase the engine braking effect. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to the \n\nbrake system overheating \n\nIf you leave your foot on the brake pedal when driving, the brake system may overheat. This increases the braking distance and the brake system can even fail. # Never use the brake pedal as a footrest. # Do not depress the brake pedal and the accelerator pedal at the same time while driving. \n\n* NOTE Wearing out the brake linings by \n\nso that the engine is running at a medium to high engine speed (/ page 126). \n\n% Change the shift range in good time when \n\ncruise control is activated. Observe the driving tips (/ page 112). \n\nYou thereby make use of the braking effect of the engine and do not have to brake as often to main- tain the speed. This relieves the load on the service brake and prevents the brakes from over- heating and wearing too quickly. \n\nHeavy and light loads If the brakes have been subjected to a heavy load, do not stop the vehicle immediately. Drive on for a short while. The brakes cool down more quickly in the airflow. If the brakes have been used only moderately, you should occasionally test their effectiveness. To do this, brake more firmly from a higher speed while paying attention to the traffic conditions. The brakes will grip better as a result. \n\nWet road surfaces If you have been driving for a long time in heavy rain without braking, there may be a delayed response when you first apply the brakes. This may also occur after driving through a car wash or deep water. You must depress the brake pedal more firmly. Maintain a greater distance to the vehicle in front. While paying attention to the traffic conditions, you should brake the vehicle firmly after driving on a wet road surface or through a car wash. This heats the brake disks so that they dry more quickly, which protects them against corrosion. Limited braking effect on salt-treated roads: R a layer of salt on the brake disks or brake lin- \n\nings can increase braking distances considera- bly, or braking may happen on only one side R maintain an especially large safe distance to \n\ncontinuously depressing the brake pedal \n\nthe vehicle in front \n\n# Do not depress the brake pedal continu- \n\nously whilst driving. \n\nTo remove the layer of salt: R apply the brakes from time to time, paying \n\n# To use the braking effect of the engine, shift to a lower gear in good time. \n\nattention to traffic conditions \n\nR carefully depress the brake pedal at the end of \n\nDownhill gradients \n\na journey and after the start of a new journey \n\nOn long and steep downhill gradients you should observe the following instructions: R in vehicles with an automatic transmission, \n\nshift down to shift ranges 2 or 1 in good time \n\nChecking the brake lining thickness In addition to monitoring using the brake lining wear sensor, regularly monitor and check all of the brake linings by performing a visual inspection to look for material wear on the pads. \n\n116 Driving and parking \n\nIf you are unable to check the brake lining wear on the inside of the wheels, remove the wheels if you possess the required skills, or visit a qualified spe- cialist workshop. If the brake lining material thickness is less than 0.12 in (3 mm), have the brake linings checked and replaced at a qualified specialist workshop, if nec- essary. Do not solely rely on the brake lining wear sensor. It is also strongly recommended that you have the brake linings checked at a qualified specialist workshop, not only at every service displayed by the maintenance interval display, but also prior to long journeys and whenever the wheels are removed. In the following situations, check the brake linings: R at every service according to maintenance \n\n# If the wheels lock, immediately release the parking brake as much as required for the wheels to turn again. \n\nWhen driving on wet roads or dirt-covered surfa- ces, road salt or dirt may get into the parking brake. This causes corrosion and a reduction of braking force. In order to prevent this, drive with the parking brake lightly applied from time to time. When doing so, drive for a distance of approx- imately 300 ft at a maximum speed of 13 mph (20 km/h). The brake lights do not light up when you brake the vehicle with the parking brake. \n\n▌Information about driving on wet roads \n\ninterval \n\nHydroplaning \n\nR before long journeys R every time a tire is replaced R during regular visual inspections for your own \n\nsafety \n\nNew brake disks and brake linings New brake linings and brake disks only reach their optimal braking effect after a few hundred miles (a few hundred kilometers). Until then, compensate for the reduced braking effect by applying greater pressure to the brake pedal. For safety reasons, Mercedes-Benz recom- mends that you only have brake linings and brake disks which are approved by Mercedes-Benz instal- led on your vehicle. Other brake disks or brake linings may compro- mise the safety of your vehicle. Always replace all brake disks and brake linings on an axle at the same time. Always install new brake linings when replacing brake disks. \n\nVehicles with a manual parking brake \n\n& WARNING Risk of skidding or an accident \n\nby braking with the parking brake \n\nIf you have to brake your vehicle with the park- ing brake, the braking distance is considerably longer and the wheels may lock. There is an increased risk of skidding and/or accident. # Only brake the vehicle with the parking brake if the service brake has failed. # In this case, do not apply the parking \n\n& WARNING Risk of aquaplaning because \n\ntire tread is too low \n\nDepending on the depth of the water on the roadway, aquaplaning can occur despite suffi- cient tire tread depth and low speed. # Avoid tire ruts and brake carefully. \n\nTherefore, in heavy rain or other conditions in which hydroplaning can occur, drive as follows: R Reduce your speed R Avoid tire ruts R Brake carefully \n\nDriving on flooded roads Bear in mind that vehicles traveling in front or in the opposite direction create waves. This may cause the maximum permissible depth of water to be exceeded. These notes must be observed under all circumstances. Otherwise, you can damage the engine, electrics and transmission. If you have to drive on stretches of road on which water has collected, please bear in mind the fol- lowing: R The water level of standing water may not be above the lower edge of the front bumper. R You may drive no faster than walking pace. \n\nObserve the notes on fording while off-road for all- wheel drive vehicles (/ page 117). \n\nbrake with too much force. \n\nDriving and parking 117 \n\n▌Information about driving in winter \n\n& DANGER Risk of fatal injury due to poison- \n\nous exhaust gases \n\nIf the tailpipe is blocked or sufficient ventilation is not possible, poisonous exhaust gases such as carbon monoxide may enter the vehicle. This is the case when the vehicle becomes stuck in snow, for example. # Keep the tailpipe and the area around the vehicle free from snow when the engine or the stationary heater are running. # Open a window on the side of the vehicle facing away from the wind to ensure an adequate supply of fresh air. \n\nAn accumulation of snow and ice, particularly when frozen, in the area around the air intake, moving parts, the axles, and the wheel wells may cause the following problems: R Obstruction of the air intake R Damage to vehicle parts R Malfunctions due to restriction of the mobility intended by the design (e.g. reduced steering movement) \n\nIf there is any damage, inform a qualified specialist workshop. \n\n▌Information about driving off-road \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident if you do not \n\nkeep to line of fall on inclines \n\n& WARNING Risk of skidding and of an acci- dent due to shifting down on slippery road surfaces \n\nIf you shift down on slippery road surfaces to increase the engine braking effect, the drive wheels may lose traction. # Do not shift down on slippery road surfa- ces to increase the engine braking effect. \n\nVehicles with automatic transmissions are permit- ted to roll when in neutral i for only a short time. Allowing the wheels to roll for longer, e.g. when towing, causes transmission damage. If the vehicle threatens to skid, or cannot be brought to a standstill when traveling at a low speed, you can stabilize the vehicle using the fol- lowing measures: R Shift the automatic transmission to neutral i. R Try to maintain control of the vehicle using cor- \n\nrective steering. \n\nDrive particularly carefully on slippery roads. Avoid sudden acceleration, steering and braking maneu- vers. Have your vehicle winterized at a qualified special- ist workshop in good time at the onset of winter. Observe the notes on snow chains (/ page 244). Regularly check the vehicle and remove snow or ice when traveling in wintry conditions. \n\nIf you drive at an angle or turn on an incline, the vehicle could slip sideways, tip and rollover. # Always drive on inclines in the line of fall (straight up or down) and do not turn. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury from acceleration \n\nforces during off-road driving \n\nYou could be thrown from your seat, for exam- ple. # Always wear your seat belt even when \n\ndriving off-road. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury to the hands when \n\ndriving over obstacles \n\nIf you drive over obstacles or in tire ruts, the steering wheel may whip around. # The steering wheel must always be held \n\nsecurely with both hands. \n\n# Always hold the steering wheel so that your thumbs are on the outer rim of the steering wheel. \n\n# When driving over obstacles, expect \n\nincreased steering forces at short notice. \n\n& WARNING Risk of fire caused by flamma- ble material on hot exhaust system com- ponents \n\nFlammable material such as leaves, grass or twigs may ignite if they come into contact with hot parts of the exhaust system. \n\n118 Driving and parking \n\n# When driving on an unpaved road or off- road, check the vehicle underside regu- larly. \n\n# In particular, remove trapped plant parts \n\nor other flammable material. \n\n# If there is damage, consult a qualified specialist workshop immediately. \n\n* NOTE Damage to the vehicle after driving \n\noff-road \n\nForeign bodies, such as stones and branches, could become trapped on the vehicle under- side or on wheels and tires while you are driv- ing and cause damage to the vehicle. Foreign bodies could cause the following dam- age: R Damage the suspension, the fuel tank or \n\nthe brake system \n\nR Cause imbalances and thus vibrations \n\n# Regularly remove any trapped foreign bodies, e.g. stones and branches. # After driving off-road, check carefully \n\nwhether there is any damage to the vehi- cle. \n\n# If there is damage, have the vehicle \n\nchecked at a qualified specialist work- shop. \n\noil, can get into the brakes. This may lead to a reduction in braking effect or total brake failure, including as a result of increased wear. The brak- ing characteristics will vary depending on the material that has got into the system. Clean the brakes after driving off-road. If you then notice a reduced braking effect or hear scraping noises, have the brake system checked immediately at a qualified specialist workshop. Adjust your driving style to the changed braking characteristics. Driving off-road or on construction sites increases the possibility of vehicle damage which may in turn lead to the failure of certain major assemblies and systems. Adapt your driving style to the off-road driving conditions. Drive carefully. Have any vehicle damage rectified at a qualified specialist workshop as soon as possible. When driving on rough cross-country terrain, do not shift the transmission to neutral and do not disengage the clutch. You could lose control when attempting to brake the vehicle with the service brake. If your vehicle cannot manage an uphill incline, drive back down in reverse gear. When loading your vehicle for off-road driving or on a construction site, keep the vehicle's center of gravity as low as possible. \n\nCheck-list before off-road driving R Check the fuel and DEF® levels (/ page 176) \n\nand refill if necessary (/ page 133). \n\nWhen driving off-road or on unpaved surfaces, check the vehicle underside, wheels and tires at regular intervals. In particular, remove any trapped foreign bodies, e.g. stones and branches.

When driving off-road on steep inclines, you must make sure that the DEF® tank is sufficiently filled. Therefore, ensure a level of at least 2.6 gal (10 l) before off-road driving. When driving off-road and on construction sites, sand, mud and water, for example, also mixed with \n\nR Make sure that a lug wrench (/ page 261), a wooden underlay for the jack, a robust tow rope, a folding spade and a wheel chock (may be present, depending on equipment) are car- ried in the vehicle. \n\nR Tires and wheels: check the tire tread depth \n\n(/ page 243) and the tire pressure (/ page 250). \n\nDriving and parking 119 \n\nRules for off-road driving Always be aware of the vehicle's ground clearance, and avoid obstacles such as deep tire ruts. Obstacles can damage the following parts of the vehicle, for example: R suspension R drivetrain R fuel and operating fluid reservoirs \n\nTherefore, always drive slowly when off-road. If you must drive over obstacles, have the co-driver instruct you. % Mercedes-Benz recommends that you addi- tionally carry a shovel and a recovery rope with a shackle in the vehicle. \n\nR Make sure that loads and items of luggage are securely stored or lashed down (/ page 208). \n\nR Before driving off-road, stop the vehicle and \n\nengage a low gear. \n\nObserve the following if you must drive through water: R The water, when calm, may only reach the \n\nlower edge of the front bumper. \n\nR Drive at walking pace at most; water can other- wise enter the vehicle interior or engine com- partment. \n\nR Vehicles traveling in front, or oncoming vehi- cles, can create waves which may exceed the maximum permissible height of the water. \n\nThe braking effect of the brakes is reduced after fording. Brake carefully while paying attention to the traffic conditions until braking power has been fully restored. After the vehicle has forded at maximum depth several times, all oils in the major assemblies (front axle differential, locking differential, manual trans- mission/automatic transmission and transfer case) must be replaced. \n\nR Vehicles with DSR: activate DSR when you are \n\ndriving downhill (/ page 151). \n\nRules for off-road fording R Observe the safety notes and general notes on \n\nR All-wheel drive vehicles with engine OM642 or  \n\ndriving off-road. \n\nengine OM651: activate all-wheel drive (/ page 127) and, if necessary, activate the LOW RANGE transmission ratio (/ page 128). \n\nR If the surface requires, temporarily deactivate ESP® when pulling away (/ page 146). \n\nR Check the depth and characteristics of the \n\nbody of water before fording.

Exercise the utmost caution when driving across unfamiliar, unpredictable terrain. \n\nR Look out for obstacles (e.g. rocks, holes, tree \n\nstumps and tire ruts). \n\nR Avoid edges where the surface could crumble \n\nor break away. \n\nNotes on driving when there is water on the road Water which has entered the vehicle can damage the engine, electrics and transmission. Water can also enter the air intake fitting of the engine and cause engine damage. \n\nR Activate all-wheel drive and activate the LOW RANGE transmission ratio (/ page 128). \n\nR Restrict the shift range to 1 or 2. R Avoid high engine speeds. R Drive slowly and smoothly at no more than a \n\nwalking pace. \n\nR Ensure that no wave forms at the front of the \n\nvehicle while driving. \n\nR After fording, dry the brakes. R After the vehicle has forded at maximum depth several times, all oils in the major assemblies (front axle differential, locking differential, manual transmission/automatic transmission and transfer case) must be replaced. \n\nCheck-list after driving off-road Driving over rough terrain places greater demands on your vehicle than normal road operation. Check your vehicle after driving on rough terrain. This allows you to detect damage promptly and reduce \n\n120 Driving and parking \n\nthe risk of an accident for yourself and other road users. Clean your vehicle thoroughly before driving on public roads. If you find damage to the vehicle after off-road driving, have the vehicle checked at a qualified specialist workshop immediately. Observe the following points after driving off-road, on construction sites and before driving on public roads: R Vehicles with DSR: deactivate DSR \n\n(/ page 151). \n\nR All-wheel drive vehicles with engine OM642 or  engine OM651: deactivate all-wheel drive (/ page 127). \n\nwheels and the drivetrain, visit a qualified spe- cialist workshop immediately. \n\nDeactivating/activating the reverse warning device \n\n& WARNING Risk of accidents due to per- sons or objects in the area in which you are maneuvering \n\nOther road users may not hear or may ignore the warning tone of the backing up warning device. There is a risk of an accident. # Make sure that there are no persons or objects in the maneuvering area during maneuvering. \n\nR Activate ESP® (/ page 146).

R Clean the windshield, windows and outside \n\nmirrors. \n\nR Clean the steps, entrances and grab handles. \n\nThis will make your footing safer. \n\nR Clean the wheels and tires, wheel wells and \n\nthe underbody of the vehicle with a water jet. This increases road adhesion, especially on wet road surfaces. \n\nR Check the wheels and tires and wheel wells for trapped foreign objects and remove them. Trapped foreign objects can damage the wheels and tires or may be flung out from the vehicle when the journey is continued. \n\nR Check the underbody for trapped branches or \n\nother parts of plants and remove them. R Clean the brake disks, brakepads and axle joints, particularly after operation in sand, mud, grit and gravel, water or similarly dirty conditions. \n\nR Check the entire floor assembly, the tires, \n\nwheels, bodywork structure, brakes, steering, suspension and exhaust system for any dam- age. \n\nR Check the service brake for operating safety, \n\ne.g. carry out a brake test. \n\nR If you notice strong vibrations after driving off- road, check the wheels and drivetrain for for- eign objects again. Remove any foreign objects which can lead to imbalances and thus cause vibrations.

Inhaling these exhaust gases is hazardous to health and leads to poisoning. # Never leave the engine or, if present, the auxiliary heating running in an enclosed space without sufficient ventilation. \n\n& WARNING Risk of fire caused by hot \n\nexhaust system parts \n\nFlammable materials such as leaves, grass or twigs may ignite. \n\n122 Driving and parking \n\n# Park the vehicle so that no flammable \n\nmaterial can come into contact with hot vehicle components. \n\n# In particular, do not park on dry grass- \n\nland or harvested grain fields. \n\nminutes every 500 km (300 miles). This facilitates the diesel particulate filter's burn-off process. % Manual regeneration of the diesel particulate filter when stationary is classified as special equipment and is not installed as standard. \n\n▌Starting and canceling regeneration \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident with regenera- \n\ntion activated \n\nThe transmission is in neutral if the vehicle has a manual transmission and the regeneration of the diesel particulate filter is activated. The vehicle may thereby inadvertently roll away. # Apply the parking brake. # Turn the front wheels towards or away \n\nfrom the curb on steep uphill or downhill gradients. # Use a chock. \n\nRequirements:  R All system conditions are fulfilled. R The load condition of the diesel particulate fil- \n\nter is at least 100%. R The vehicle is stationary. R The vehicle has been started. R If the vehicle has a transmission-mounted power take-off, the latter is deactivated. R If the vehicle has a parameterizable special module, the rpm request is deactivated. \n\n* NOTE Damage due to hot exhaust gases \n\nOn-board computer: 4 Service  5 Particle Filter \n\nVery hot exhaust gases are emitted from the tailpipe during regeneration. # During regeneration, maintain a minimum distance of 7 ft (2 m) to other objects, e.g. parked vehicles. \n\n# Carry out regeneration only on concrete \n\nor asphalt surfaces. \n\n# Do not carry out regeneration in the \n\n# To request regeneration: Select OK. # To observe the vehicle surroundings: Make \n\nsure that no injuries or damage due to the hot exhaust gases can occur in the vehicle sur- roundings.

Regeneration without interruption takes approx. 20–25 minutes. If the vehicle is predominantly used for short-dis- tance driving or has extended non-operational times, this could lead to a malfunction in the auto- matic cleaning function of the diesel particulate fil- ter. As a result, the diesel particulate filter may become blocked. Fuel may also accumulate in the engine oil and cause engine damage. If you mainly drive short distances, you should drive on a freeway or go for a country drive for 20 \n\n% The duration of regeneration depends on the load condition of the diesel particulate filter (approx. 20‑25 minutes). After successful regeneration, the engine speed is reduced again. \n\n# To cancel regeneration: Switch off the vehicle \n\nor depress the clutch (for manual transmission) or brake (for automatic transmission). Regeneration is canceled. \n\nRegeneration cannot be requested again until the load condition of the diesel particulate filter is at least 100%. \n\n▌Displaying the load On-board computer: 4 Service  5 Consumption Info \n\nThe load of the diesel particulate filter is displayed. \n\nDriving and parking 123 \n\nSwitching the power supply on/off \n\nSwitching off the power supply \n\nLoad display at 75% load \n\n# To exit the display: press the back button on the left-hand side of the steering wheel. \n\nBear in mind the following related topic: R Operating the on-board com- \n\nputer(/ page 177) \n\nBattery main switch \n\nBattery main switch \n\nNotes on the battery main switch \n\n% Note the remaining time before the next \n\n* NOTE Damaged to control units and \n\ncooled component parts \n\nservice due date (/ page 213) and oil change (/ page 278). The time recording is also dis- rupted if the power supply is disconnected. \n\nWhen the main battery switch is removed immediately, cooling of important component parts and the storage of parameters in the control units can be interrupted. This can sig- nificantly reduce the service life of component parts and control units. # Make sure that vehicle is switched off. Then wait at least 20 minutes before removing the battery main switch. \n\nYou can use the battery main switch to disconnect the current to all your vehicle's consumers. This will prevent uncontrolled battery discharge caused by quiescent current consumers. If your vehicle is equipped with an auxiliary battery in the engine compartment or in the base of the front passenger seat, you must disconnect both batteries. Only then will the electrical system be fully disconnected from the power supply. % Disconnect the vehicle from the power supply \n\nonly using the battery main switch in the fol- lowing situations: R the vehicle is stationary for a long time R it is absolutely necessary to disconnect the vehicle from the power supply \n\n# Switch off the vehicle and wait at least 20 \n\nminutes. \n\n# Remove cover 1.

R operate vehicle equipment and become \n\ntrapped, for example. \n\nIn addition, the children could also set the vehicle in motion, for example by: R releasing the parking brake. R changing the transmission position. R starting the vehicle. \n\nj Park position k Reverse gear i Neutral h Drive position \n\n▌Engaging reverse gear R \n\n# Never leave children unattended in the \n\nvehicle. \n\n# When leaving the vehicle, always take the SmartKey with you and lock the vehicle. # Keep the vehicle SmartKey out of reach \n\nof children. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to incor- \n\nrect gearshifting \n\nIf the engine speed is higher than the idle speed and you engage the transmission posi- tion h or k, the vehicle may accelerate sharply. # If you engage the transmission position h or k when the vehicle is at a stand- still, always depress the brake pedal firmly and do not accelerate at the same time. \n\n# Depress the brake pedal and push the DIRECT SELECT lever upwards past the first point of resistance. The transmission position display will show k on the instrument cluster. \n\nYou use the DIRECT SELECT lever to switch the transmission position. The current transmission position will appear on the display of the instru- ment cluster (/ page 178). The shifting characteristics of the automatic trans- mission are designed for comfortable and econom- ical handling. For this reason, the display of the instrument cluster shows, in addition to the trans- mission position display, the A for Comfort. \n\n▌Selecting neutral N \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident and injury when neutral position is engaged \n\nIf you park the vehicle with the transmission in neutral position i and the parking brake is not engaged, the vehicle may roll away. There is a risk of accident and injury. # Before parking the vehicle, apply the \n\nparking brake. \n\nDriving and parking 125 \n\n# Press button 1. \n\nTransmission position display j will be shown on the instrument cluster. \n\nPark position j is engaged automatically when one of the following conditions is met: R You switch the vehicle off with the transmis- \n\nsion in position h or k. \n\nR You open the driver's door when the vehicle is stationary or moving at a very low speed and with the transmission in position h or k. \n\n▌Engaging drive position D \n\n# Press the brake pedal and the DIRECT SELECT lever upwards or downwards to the first point of resistance. Transmission position display i is shown in the instrument cluster. \n\nSubsequently releasing the brake pedal will allow you to move the vehicle freely, e.g. to push it or tow it away. \n\nIf the automatic transmission should also stay in neutral i when the vehicle is switched off, carry out the following: # Start the vehicle. # Depress the brake pedal and engage neutral \n\ni. \n\n# Release the brake pedal. # Switch off the vehicle. % If you then leave the vehicle and the key is still in the vehicle, the automatic transmission will stay in neutral i from then on. \n\n▌Engaging park position P \n\n# Depress the brake pedal and push the DIRECT SELECT lever downwards past the first point of resistance. Transmission position display h is shown in the instrument cluster. \n\nThe automatic transmission shifts through the indi- vidual gears automatically when it is in transmis- sion position h.

The automatic transmission shifts to the next gear up, depending on the gear currently engaged. This derestricts the shift range at the same time. The selected shift range is shown in the instru- ment cluster display. The automatic transmis- sion shifts only as far as the selected gear. # To derestrict the shift range: pull and hold \n\nsteering wheel paddle shifter 2. \n\nor # Engage transmission position h again \n\n# To restrict the shift range: briefly pull steering \n\nwheel paddle shifter 1. The automatic transmission shifts to the next lower gear, depending on the gear currently engaged. The shift range is also restricted. The selected shift range is shown in the instru- ment cluster display. The automatic transmis- sion shifts only as far as the selected gear. # Pull and hold steering wheel paddle shifter 1. The automatic transmission will change to a shift range which allows easy acceleration and deceleration. To do this, the automatic trans- mission shifts down one or more gears and restricts the shift range. The selected shift range is shown in the instru- ment cluster display. The automatic transmis- sion shifts only as far as the selected gear. \n\n(/ page 125). The automatic transmission shifts up one or more gears depending on the gear currently engaged. Simultaneously, the shift range restriction is deactivated and transmission position h appears in the instrument cluster display. \n\nRecommended shift ranges for the following driv- ing conditions: 3 Use the engine's braking effect. 2 Use the engine's braking effect on downhill \n\ngradients and when driving on steep roads, in mountainous areas and under arduous operat- ing conditions. \n\n1 Use the engine's braking effect on extremely steep downhill gradients and on long downhill stretches. \n\nUsing kickdown \n\n# For maximum acceleration: depress the accel- \n\nerator pedal beyond the pressure point. # Ease off the accelerator pedal once the \n\n% The automatic transmission does not shift \n\ndesired speed is reached. \n\ndown if you pull steering wheel paddle shifter 1 while traveling at too high a speed. For vehicles with engine OM642, OM651,  OM654: the automatic transmission does not shift up if the shift range is restricted and the maximum engine speed of the restricted shift range has been reached. For vehicles with engine M274: if the maxi- mum engine speed for the restricted shift range is reached and you continue to depress the accelerator pedal, the automatic transmis- sion will shift up automatically. \n\nAll-wheel drive \n\nNotes on all-wheel drive \n\nAll-wheel drive ensures permanent drive for all four wheels and, together with ESP®, improves the trac- tion of the vehicle. With the OM651 and OM642 engines, all-wheel drive must be switched on . With the OM654 engine, there is smart closed-loop control of the drive torque between the front and rear axles. Traction control for all-wheel drive also takes place via the brake system. This may cause the brake \n\nDriving and parking 127 \n\nsystem to overheat. Decelerate or stop to let the brake system cool down. If a wheel spins due to insufficient traction, observe the following notes: R When pulling away, make use of the traction \n\ncontrol integrated in ESP®. Depress the accel- erator pedal as far as necessary. \n\nEngaging/disengaging all-wheel drive \n\n* NOTE Risk of damage to the transfer case \n\nThe transfer case may be damaged if you depress the accelerator pedal while engaging or disengaging the all-wheel drive. # Do not depress the accelerator pedal \n\nR Take your foot off the accelerator pedal, slowly, \n\nwhile the vehicle is in motion. \n\nwhile the indicator lamp in the all-wheel drive switch is flashing. \n\nIn wintry driving conditions, always use winter tires (M+S tires) and, if necessary, snow chains (/ page 244). Only in this way can the maximum effect of all-wheel drive be achieved. Use DSR (Downhill Speed Regulation) when driving downhill off-road (/ page 151). If you fail to adapt your driving style or if you are inattentive, the all-wheel drive system can neither reduce the risk of an accident nor override the laws of physics. The all-wheel drive system cannot take road, weather and traffic conditions into account. The all-wheel drive system is only an aid. You are responsible for maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, for vehicle speed, for braking in good time and for staying in lane. \n\n* NOTE Risk of damage to the drivetrain and \n\nthe brake system \n\nIf you operate vehicles with all-wheel drive on a one-axle test stand, you may damage the drive- train or the brake system. # A function or performance test should only be carried out on a two-axle test stand. \n\n# If you wish to operate the vehicle on such a test stand, please consult a qualified specialist workshop in advance. \n\n* NOTE Risk of damage to the transfer case \n\nIf you tow the vehicle with a raised axle, the transfer case can get damaged. Such damage is not covered by Mercedes-Benz Limited War- ranty. # Never tow the vehicle with a raised axle. # Only tow the vehicle with all wheels on \n\nthe ground or fully raised. \n\n# To engage/disengage: press the upper section \n\nof switch 1. The indicator lamp in switch 1 flashes while the all-wheel drive is engaged or disengaged. The ÷ and : warning lamps light up in the instrument cluster. ESP® and ASR are deactivated for the duration of the shift opera- tion. Once the engaging/disengaging process has been completed, the ÷ and : warn- ing lamps in the instrument cluster go out and ESP® and ASR are reactivated. \n\nAs long as the indicator lamp in switch 1 is flash- ing, you can cancel the shift operation by pressing switch 1 again. If the shift operation fails, the indicator lamp in switch 1 briefly flashes three times. One of the shift conditions was not met. If the indicator lamp in switch 1 lights up, all- wheel drive is engaged. % If the LOW RANGE transmission ratio is \n\nengaged, the all-wheel drive cannot be disen- gaged. \n\n# Note the instructions on towing the vehi- cle with full contact with the ground for all wheels. \n\nConditions for engaging/disengaging You can engage and deactivate the all-wheel drive when stationary or while driving slowly. \n\n128 Driving and parking \n\nWhen stationary, observe the following: R The vehicle has been started. R The steering wheel in the straight-ahead posi- \n\nEngaging and disengaging LOW range \n\ntion. \n\nIf the all-wheel drive cannot be engaged when sta- tionary: # Vehicles with automatic transmission: shift the selector lever from i to h from h to i from i to k and back to i. Engaging and disengaging the all-wheel drive can be made easier in this way. \n\nObserve the following when driving slowly: R The vehicle has been started. R The vehicle is not traveling faster than 6.2 mph \n\n(10 km/h). \n\nR The vehicle is not being driven around a curve. \n\nIf it is not possible to engage all-wheel drive when the vehicle is rolling: # Vehicles with automatic transmission: briefly \n\nmove the selector lever to i. \n\nFunction of the LOW RANGE transmission ratio \n\nThe LOW RANGE transmission ratio enables very slow driving in the respective gears. If you engage LOW RANGE, the engine's performance character- istics and the automatic transmission's shifting characteristics are adapted accordingly. The trans- mission ratio from the engine to the wheels is around 40% lower than in the road position. The drive torque is increased correspondingly. Conditions for engaging/disengaging The following shifting conditions must be met in order to engage or disengage LOW RANGE: R All-wheel drive is engaged (/ page 127). R The vehicle has been started. R The vehicle is stationary. R You depress the brake pedal. R Vehicles with automatic transmission: the selector lever is in position j or i. \n\n% On vehicles with DSR (Downhill Speed Regula- tion), switch 1 is replaced with the switch for DSR. \n\n# To engage and disengage: Press the upper sec- \n\ntion of switch 1. The + indicator lamp will flash on the instrument cluster for the duration of the shift operation . R When the shift operation takes place and LOW RANGE is engaged, the + indica- tor lamp will light up. \n\nR When the shift operation takes place and LOW RANGE is disengaged, the + indi- cator lamp will go out. \n\nAs long as the + indicator lamp is flashing, you can cancel the shift operation by pressing button 1 again. If the shift operation fails, the + indi- cator lamp will flash briefly three times. This means that one of the shift conditions has not been met. \n\nElectronic level control \n\nFunction of ENR (electronic level control) \n\n& WARNING Risk of entrapment from vehicle \n\nlowering \n\nWhen lowering the vehicle, people could become trapped if their limbs are between the vehicle body and the tires or underneath the vehicle. # Make sure no one is underneath the vehi- cle or in the immediate vicinity of the \n\nwheel arches when the vehicle is being lowered. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury due to the jack \n\ntipping over \n\nIf you park a vehicle with air suspension, the air suspension can remain active for up to an hour, even if the vehicle is switched off. If you then raise the vehicle using the jack, the air suspension will attempt to even out the vehicle level. The jack can tip over. # Before raising the vehicle, press the \n\nService button on the remote control for the air suspension. This prevents the vehicle level from being automatically readjusted or manually raised or lowered. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to lowered \n\nor raised chassis frame \n\nIf the chassis frame is adjusted, the braking and driving characteristics can be severely impaired. You could also exceed the permissi- ble vehicle height. # Adjust the driving level before driving off. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to a mal- function of electronic level control \n\nThe vehicle level may be too high, too low or asymmetrical. The driving and steering characteristics of the vehicle may be noticeably different. # Adapt your driving style to the changed \n\ndriving characteristics. \n\n# Stop, paying attention to road and traffic \n\nconditions. \n\n# Consult a qualified specialist workshop. \n\n* NOTE Risk of damage to the chassis from \n\nlowered vehicle level \n\nIf electronic level control is malfunctioning or readjusts while you are driving, the vehicle level may be lowered. # Pay attention to the road conditions and ensure there is sufficient ground clear- ance. \n\n# Drive carefully. \n\nDriving and parking 129 \n\nThe level of the vehicle depends on vehicle load and the load distribution. Electronic level control adjusts the level of the rear axle automatically on vehicles with an air-sprung rear axle. The vehicle level is thereby always maintained at the driving level, regardless of vehicle load. Driving dynamics remain unaffected. The height difference between the sides of the vehicle may be up to 0.4 in (1 cm). Electronic level control is not engine-dependent and is only operational when the vehicle is switched on. The electronic level control compres- sor works audibly. % If the compressor works constantly or starts up several times per minute, electronic level control is malfunctioning. \n\nDepending on the vehicle's equipment, electronic level control switches between manual mode and automatic mode. This is dependent on the driving speed or the parking brake position. If electronic level control switches depending on vehicle speed, manual operation is automatically activated when the vehicle is stationary. You may raise or lower the vehicle level. If you subsequently drive faster than 6 mph (10 km/h), manual mode is automatically deactivated and automatic mode sets the vehicle level. If electronic level control switches depending on the parking brake position, manual mode is auto- matically activated when the parking brake is applied. You may raise or lower the vehicle level to load and unload. If you release the parking brake, manual mode is automatically deactivated and automatic mode sets the driving level. When working on the vehicle or changing a wheel, you can deactivate electronic level control (/ page 130). If electronic level control is malfunctioning or the vehicle level is too high or too low, a warning tone sounds. The driving and steering characteristics of the vehi- cle will be noticeably different. Electronic level control adjusts the vehicle level to the normal level as soon as possible. Drive on carefully until the warning tone stops. Only then is the vehicle at nor- mal level. To restore the vehicle level, automatic mode and electronic level control automatically switch on again depending on the option selected: R when the parking brake is released R from speeds of approximately 6 mph \n\n(10 km/h) \n\n130 Driving and parking \n\nIf the electronic level control compressor is in dan- ger of overheating, for example, due to repeated raising or lowering within a short period, electronic level control is deactivated. You can raise or lower the vehicle level again after a few minutes. \n\nIn addition, a warning tone is emitted from the remote control for approximately 30 seconds. The malfunction that has been detected can be shown using the indicator lamps (signaling of malfunction codes). # Park the vehicle safely and leave it switched \n\nRaising and lowering the vehicle level \n\non. \n\nUsing the remote control % Certain special equipment enables other oper- \n\nation options: R Ambulance: raising the vehicle level above the driving level (center position) is not possible.

The remote control is located in a holder on the B‑pillar on the driver's side. Remove the remote control from the holder before use. \n\nThe indicator lamp on button 5 flashes as long as the vehicle level is being changed. When the vehicle level has been set, the indi- cator lamp on button 5 lights up. \n\n% By pressing button 4 during the movement, \n\nthe original position will be reset. \n\n# To raise automatically: briefly press button 4. Electronic level control automatically raises the vehicle to the next higher position: R From the lowest position to driving level R From driving level to the highest position \n\nElectronic level control starts automatically if the vehicle is switched on.

The driving systems are only aids. They are not a substitute for you paying attention to your sur- roundings and do not relieve you of your responsi- bility pertaining to road traffic law. The driver is always responsible for maintaining a safe distance to the vehicle in front, for vehicle speed, for brak- ing in good time and for staying in lane. Always pay attention to the traffic and intervene if necessary. Be aware of the limitations regarding the safe use of these systems. Driving systems can neither reduce the risk of accident if you fail to adapt your driving style nor override the laws of physics. They cannot always take into account road, weather or traffic condi- tions. \n\nInformation about sensors \n\nthe media display. \n\nR The connection to online services is interrup- \n\nted. \n\nR The ATA (anti-theft alarm system) is unavaila- \n\nble. \n\nR The interior protection and tow-away alarm \n\nfunctions are not available. \n\nExceeding the vehicle's displayed non-operational time may cause inconvenience; i.e. it cannot be guaranteed that the starter battery will reliably start the vehicle. Charge the starter battery first in the following sit- uations: R In order to extend the vehicle's non-opera- \n\ntional time. \n\nR The Battery Charge Insufficient for Standby  Mode message appears in the media display. \n\n% Standby mode is automatically deactivated \n\nwhen the vehicle is switched on. \n\nOn-board computer: 4 Settings  5 Vehicle  5 Standby Mode \n\n# To activate/deactivate: selectYes or No. % If the options are grayed out, the charge level of the battery is not sufficient for standby mode. \n\nCertain driving and driving safety systems use sen- sors 1 to monitor the area in front of, behind or next to the vehicle (depending on the vehicle's equipment). Depending on the vehicle's equipment, the radar sensors are integrated behind the bumpers and/or behind the radiator grille. Keep these parts free of dirt, ice and slush (/ page 223). Do not cover the sensors, for example, with bicycle racks, overhang- ing loads or stickers. After a collision, have the function of the radar sensors checked at a quali- fied specialist workshop as the bumper or radiator grille may have sustained damage that cannot be seen by the naked eye. \n\nDriving and parking 145 \n\nFunction of driving systems and driving safety sys- tems \n\nIn this section, you will find information about the following driving systems and driving safety sys- tems: R ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) (/ page 145) R ASR (acceleration skid control) (/ page 145) R BAS (Brake Assist System) (/ page 145) R ESP® (Electronic Stability Program) \n\nIf ABS intervenes, you will feel pulsations in the brake pedal. The pulsating brake pedal may be an indication of hazardous road conditions and func- tions as a reminder to take extra care while driving. If ABS intervenes: keep the brake pedal firmly depressed until the braking situation has passed. To carry out maximum full-stop braking: depress the brake pedal with full force. \n\nFunction of BAS (Brake Assist System) \n\n(/ page 146) \n\nR EBD (Electronic Brakeforce Distribution) \n\n(/ page 147) \n\n& WARNING Risk of an accident caused by a malfunction in BAS (Brake Assist System) \n\nR Active Brake Assist (/ page 147) R Cruise control (/ page 150) R Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC \n\n(/ page 153) \n\nR Hill start assist (/ page 155) R HOLD function (/ page 155) R Parking Assist PARKTRONIC (/ page 156) R Rear view camera (/ page 158) R Surround view camera (/ page 160) R ATTENTION ASSIST (/ page 163) R Traffic Sign Assist (/ page 164) R Blind Spot Assist (/ page 165) R Active Lane Keeping Assist (/ page 168) \n\nIf BAS is malfunctioning, the braking distance in an emergency braking situation is increased. # Depress the brake pedal with full force in emergency braking situations. ABS pre- vents the wheels from locking. \n\nBAS supports you with additional braking force in an emergency braking situation. If you depress the brake pedal quickly, BAS is acti- vated: R BAS automatically boosts the braking force of \n\nthe brakes \n\nR BAS can shorten the braking distance R ABS prevents the wheels from locking \n\nWhen you release the brake pedal, the brakes function as usual again. BAS is deactivated. \n\nFunctions of ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) \n\nObserve the important safety guidelines for the driving safety system. ABS controls the brake pressure in critical situa- tions: R During braking, for instance, at maximum full- stop braking or if there is insufficient tire trac- tion, the wheels are prevented from locking. R The steerability of the vehicle in terms of physi- cal possibilities is ensured when braking. R ABS is active from speeds of approx. 3 mph (5 km/h). On a slippery road surface, ABS intervenes even if you only brake gently. \n\nSystem limits ABS may be impaired or may not function if a mal- function has occurred and the yellow ! ABS warning lamp lights up continuously in the instru- ment cluster after the vehicle is started. \n\nFunctions of ASR (Acceleration Skid Control) \n\nASR can neither reduce the risk of an accident nor override the laws of physics if the driver does not pay attention when pulling away or accelerating. ASR is only an aid. Always adapt your driving style to suit the prevailing road and weather conditions. If you activate or deactivate the all-wheel drive in a vehicle with this option, ASR will be deactivated for the duration of the activation/deactivation proc- ess. Vehicles without steering wheel buttons: if ASR is malfunctioning, the ÷ indicator lamp lights up while the vehicle is running and the engine output may be reduced (/ page 26). ASR improves traction, i.e. the transfer of power from the tires to the road surface, for a sustained period and therefore also improves the driving sta- bility of the vehicle. If the drive wheels start to spin, ASR brakes individual drive wheels and limits \n\n146 Driving and parking \n\nthe engine torque. ASR thus significantly assists you when pulling away and accelerating, especially on wet or slippery roads. If traction on the road surface is not sufficient, even ASR will not allow you to pull away without difficulty. The type of tires and total weight of the vehicle as well as the gradient of the road also play a crucial role. If ASR intervenes, the ÷ warning lamp in the instrument cluster flashes. \n\nFunction of ESP® (Electronic Stability Program) \n\n& WARNING Risk of skidding if ESP® is mal- \n\nfunctioning \n\nESP® can, within physical limits, monitor and improve driving stability and traction in the follow- ing situations: R when pulling away on wet or slippery road sur- \n\nfaces \n\nR when braking R if you are driving faster than 50 mph (80 km/h) in strong crosswinds \n\nIf the vehicle is deviating from the direction desired by the driver, ESP® can stabilize the vehi- cle by performing the following actions: R one or more wheels are braked R the drive system performance is adapted \n\ndepending on the situation \n\nIf ESP® is malfunctioning, ESP® cannot carry out vehicle stabilization. In addition, other driv- ing safety systems are switched off. # Drive on carefully. # Have ESP® checked at a qualified spe- \n\ncialist workshop. \n\n& WARNING Risk of skidding if ESP® is deac- \n\nWhen ESP® is deactivated by the driver, the å warning lamp in the instrument cluster lights up continuously: R vehicle stabilization may be delayed R Crosswind Assist is still active R the wheels may start to spin R ASR traction control is no longer active \n\ntivated \n\nIf you deactivate ESP®, ESP® cannot carry out vehicle stabilization. # ESP® should only be deactivated in the \n\nfollowing situations. \n\nIf the surface requires, temporarily deactivate ESP® when pulling away (/ page 146). Do not operate the vehicle on a roller dynamome- ter (e.g. for a performance test). If you have to operate the vehicle on a roller dynamometer, con- sult a qualified specialist workshop beforehand. If you activate or deactivate the all-wheel drive in a vehicle with this option, ESP® will be automatically deactivated for the duration of the activation/ deactivation process. If ESP® is malfunctioning or automatically deacti- vated, the ÷ warning lamp lights up yellow while the vehicle is running and the engine output may be reduced (/ page 26). % Only use wheels with the recommended tire size. Only then will ESP® function properly. \n\nIf ESP® is deactivated by the driver, ESP® will con- tinue to support you when braking. If the ÷ warning lamp on the instrument cluster flashes, one or more tires have reached their tire traction limit: R adapt your driving style to suit the prevailing \n\nroad and weather conditions \n\nR do not deactivate ESP® under any circumstan- \n\nces \n\nActivating/deactivating ESP® (Electronic Stability Program) \n\nMultimedia system: 4 ©  5 Settings  5 Quick Access 5 ESP % ESP® can only be activated and deactivated \n\nvia quick access when at least one other func- tion is available in quick access. Otherwise, you can find ESP® in the Assistance menu. \n\n# Select ESP. \n\nA prompt appears. # Select On or å  Off. \n\nDriving and parking 147 \n\nIf the ESP® OFF warning lamp å lights up per- manently on the instrument cluster, ESP® is deac- tivated. Observe the information on warning lamps and dis- play messages that may appear on the instrument cluster. \n\nFunction of ESP® Crosswind Assist \n\nCrosswind Assist does not react under the follow- ing conditions: R The vehicle is subjected to severe jolts and \n\nvibrations, e.g. as a result of uneven surfaces or potholes. \n\nR The vehicle loses traction, e.g. on snow or ice \n\nor when hydroplaning. \n\nR The driver is performing sudden and large \n\nIf the sensor system and evaluation logic detect trailer swinging movements, ESP® trailer stabiliza- tion initially brakes individual vehicle wheels in a targeted manner. It thus counteracts swinging movements. If the swinging movements do not stop, the vehicle is braked until the vehicle/trailer combination is stabilized. If necessary, the vehi- cle's engine output is limited. If your vehicle with trailer (vehicle/trailer combina- tion) starts to swerve, you are able to stabilize the vehicle/trailer combination only by braking. ESP® trailer stabilization helps you to stabilize the vehi- cle/trailer combination in this situation. ESP® trailer stabilization is active at speeds above approx. 40 mph (65 km/h). If ESP® is deactivated because of a malfunction, trailer stabilization will not function. \n\nsteering movements. \n\nCrosswind Assist is operational again as soon as the driving conditions return to normal. Crosswind Assist detects strong crosswind gusts that can impair the ability of your vehicle to drive straight ahead. Crosswind Assist intervenes depending on the direction and strength of the crosswind. A stabilizing brake application helps you to keep the vehicle on track. Information is shown on the instrument cluster in the event of a clearly perceptible intervention by Crosswind Assist. Crosswind Assist is active above a vehicle speed of 50 mph (80 km/h) when driving straight or during slight cornering. \n\nFunction of EBD (Electronic Brakeforce Distribu- tion) \n\nEBD has the following characteristics: R monitoring and controlling the brake pressure \n\non the rear wheels \n\nR improving driving stability when braking, espe- \n\ncially on bends \n\nFunctions of Active Brake Assist \n\nActive Brake Assist consists of the following func- tions: R Distance warning function R Autonomous braking function R Situation-dependent brake force boosting \n\nFunction of ESP® trailer stabilization \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident in poor road \n\nand weather conditions \n\nIn poor road and weather conditions, the trailer stabilization cannot prevent lurching of the vehicle/trailer combination. Trailers with a high center of gravity may tip over before ESP® detects this. # Always adapt your driving style to suit the current road and weather conditions. \n\nESP® trailer stabilization counteracts critical driv- ing situations in good time and thereby provides considerable assistance when driving with a trailer. Trailer stabilization is part of ESP®. \n\nActive Brake Assist can help you to minimize the risk of a collision with vehicles or pedestrians or to reduce the effects of such a collision. If Active Brake Assist has detected a risk of colli- sion, you will be warned visually and acoustically. If you do not react to the visual warning or warning tone, autonomous braking can be initiated in criti- cal situations. If there are pedestrians and cyclists crossing: in especially critical situations, Active Brake Assist can initiate autonomous braking directly. In this case, the optical warning and warning tone occur simultaneously with the braking application. If you apply the brake yourself in a critical situation or depress the brake pedal during autonomous braking, situation-dependent brake force boosting \n\n148 Driving and parking \n\noccurs. The brake pressure increases up to maxi- mum full-stop braking if necessary. Situation- dependent brake force boosting only intervenes when the brakes are applied firmly; otherwise, it remains within the autonomous braking process. \n\nresponsible for maintaining a safe dis- tance to the vehicle in front, for vehicle speed and for braking in good time. # Be ready to brake and take evasive \n\naction if necessary. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident in case of limi- ted detection performance of Active Brake Assist \n\nAlso observe the system limits of Active Brake Assist. \n\nActive Brake Assist cannot always clearly iden- tify objects and complex traffic situations. Due to the system, unjustified interventions or non-interventions by Brake Assist may occur in complex driving situations. In these cases, as well as in the event of malfunctions of Active Brake Assist, the brake system continues to be available with full brake force boosting and BAS. # Always keep a close eye on the traffic sit- uation and do not rely solely on Active Brake Assist. Active Brake Assist is only an aid. The driver of the vehicle is \n\nThe individual subfunctions are available in the fol- lowing speed ranges: Distance warning function The distance warning function warns you at speeds greater than approximately 4 mph (7 km/h), if your vehicle is critically close to a vehicle or pedestrian. An intermittent warning tone sounds and the · distance warning lamp lights up in the instrument cluster. Brake immediately or take evasive action, provided it is safe to do so and the traffic situation allows this. \n\nThe distance warning function can aid you in the following situations with an intermittent warning tone and a warning lamp: \n\nVehicles traveling in front \n\nStationary vehi- cles \n\nCrossing vehicles \n\nCrossing pedes- trians/cyclists \n\nStationary pedes- trians \n\nUp to approx. 155 mph (250 km/h) \n\nUp to approx. 124 mph (200 km/h) \n\nNo reaction \n\nUp to approx. 37 mph (60 km/h) \n\nNo reaction \n\nAutonomous braking function The autonomous braking function may intervene at speeds starting from approximately 4 mph (7 km/h) in the following situations: \n\nVehicles traveling in front \n\nStationary vehi- cles \n\nCrossing vehicles \n\nCrossing pedes- trians/cyclists \n\nStationary pedes- trians \n\nUp to approx. 155 mph (250 km/h) \n\nUp to approx. 124 mph (200 km/h) \n\nNo reaction \n\nUp to approx. 37 mph (60 km/h) \n\nNo reaction \n\nDriving and parking 149 \n\nSituation-dependent brake force boosting Situation-dependent brake force boosting may intervene at speeds starting from approximately 4 mph (7 km/h) in the following situations: \n\nVehicles traveling in front \n\nStationary vehi- cles \n\nCrossing vehicles \n\nCrossing pedes- trians/cyclists \n\nStationary pedes- trians \n\nUp to approx. 155 mph (250 km/h) \n\nUp to approx. 50 mph (80 km/h) \n\nNo reaction \n\nUp to approx. 37 mph (60 km/h) \n\nNo reaction \n\nCanceling a brake application of Active Brake Assist \n\nR Pedestrians are obscured by other objects.

If you accelerate to overtake, for example, the stored speed is not deleted. If you remove your foot from the accelerator pedal after overtaking, cruise control will resume speed regulation back to the stored speed. Cruise control is operated using the corresponding steering wheel buttons. You can store any speed above 15 mph (20 km/h). If you fail to adapt your driving style, cruise control can neither reduce the risk of an accident nor override the laws of physics. It cannot take into account road, weather or traffic conditions. Cruise control is only an aid. You are responsible for the distance to the vehicle in front, for vehicle speed, braking in good time and for staying in your lane. The status of cruise control and the stored speed are shown in the instrument cluster. \n\nDo not use cruise control in the following situa- tions: R In case of frequent changes of speed, e.g. in \n\nheavy traffic or winding roads \n\nR On slippery roads. The drive wheels may lose grip during acceleration and the vehicle may skid. \n\nR When visibility is poor \n\n▌Operating cruise control \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to stored \n\nspeed \n\nIf you call up the stored speed and this is lower than your current speed, the vehicle deceler- ates. # Take into account the traffic situation before calling up the stored speed. \n\nRequirements:  R ESP® is activated, but may not intervene. R The driving speed is at least 15 mph \n\n(20 km/h). \n\nInstrument cluster display (color display) 1 Cruise control is selected. 2 Set speed gray: speed is stored, cruise control \n\nis deactivated. \n\n3 Set speed green: speed is stored, cruise con- \n\ntrol is activated. \n\nSystem limits Cruise control may be unable to maintain the stored speed on uphill gradients. The stored speed is resumed when the gradient levels out. On long and steep downhill gradients, you should change down to a lower gear in good time. Take particular note of this when driving a laden vehicle. By doing so, you will make use of the engine's braking effect. This will take some of the strain off the brake system and prevent the brakes from overheating and wearing too quickly. \n\n# To activate cruise control: push rocker switch \n\n# Remove your foot from the accelerator pedal. The current speed is then saved and main- tained by the vehicle. # Push rocker switch 1 up. # To increase/reduce speed: push rocker switch \n\nor \n\n1 up. \n\n2 up or down. The stored speed is increased or reduced by 1 mph (1 km/h). \n\nDriving and parking 151 \n\n# Press rocker switch 2 up or down and hold.

The maximum permissible speed shown by the traffic sign is stored and the vehicle maintains this speed. \n\nDSR supports you when driving downhill. DSR maintains a set speed for you on downhill gradi- ents by applying the brakes as required. Maintain- ing the speed is dependent on the road surface conditions and the downhill gradient and cannot therefore be guaranteed in all situations. You can set the speed depending on the gear range to between 2 mph (4 km/h) and 11 mph (18 km/h) using the brake and accelerator pedals or the rocker switch on the steering wheel. DSR automatically controls in the following situa- tions: R If the vehicle is stationary, or its speed is less than 2 mph (4 km/h), the speed is set to 2 mph (4 km/h) or it is set to the minimum speed for the respective gear range. \n\nR If you drive faster than 11 mph (18 km/h) off- road, DSR switches to standby mode. DSR remains activated, but does not brake automat- ically. \n\nR If you drive downhill slower than 11 mph \n\n(18 km/h), DSR sets the speed to the previ- ously set speed. \n\nR If you drive faster than 28 mph (45 km/h), \n\nDSR switches off automatically. \n\n# To deactivate cruise control: push rocker \n\n▌Activating/deactivating DSR \n\nswitch 3 (CNCL) down. \n\nIf cruise control is deactivated, it can be reactiva- ted as follows: R rocker switch 2 (SET+) or (SET-) stores the current speed and the vehicle maintains this speed \n\nActivating DSR \n\nR rocker switch 3 (RES) calls up the last speed stored and the vehicle maintains this speed \n\n% If you brake, deactivate ESP® or if ESP® inter- \n\nvenes, cruise control is deactivated. When you switch off the vehicle, the last speed stored is cleared. \n\nDSR (Downhill Speed Regulation) \n\n▌Notes on DSR If you fail to adapt your driving style or you are inattentive, DSR can neither reduce the risk of accident nor override the laws of physics. DSR cannot take road, weather and traffic conditions into account. DSR is only an aid. You are responsi- ble especially for a safe distance to the vehicle in front, for vehicle speed and for braking in good time. \n\nYou can activate DSR when the vehicle is station- ary or moving. # Press the upper section of switch 1. # Brake or accelerate the vehicle to the desired speed between 2 mph (4 km/h) and 11 mph (18 km/h). \n\n152 Driving and parking \n\n# Release the brake or accelerator pedal. \n\nThe current speed is stored. When stationary, 2 mph (4 km/h) or the minimum possible speed for each gear range is stored. DSR main- tains the stored speed on the downhill gradient and brakes automatically. \n\nWhen DSR is activated and the vehicle pulls away, accelerates or brakes on an incline, the speed set corresponds to the speed at which the accelerator or brake pedal is released or the rocker switch is pressed during DSR regulation. This is only the case if you are not driving faster than 11 mph (18 km/h).

If vehicles ahead are detected, the set distance is maintained, if necessary until the vehicle comes to a halt. The vehicle accelerates or brakes, depending on the distance to the vehicle in front and the set speed. Speed and distance are set and stored on the steering wheel. The speed can be set in the range between 12 mph (20 km/h) and 99 mph (160 km/h) or between 12 mph (20 km/h) and the maximum design speed. Other features of Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC: R Depending on the preselected distance, \n\nDISTRONIC intervenes either dynamically (short distance) or to save fuel (long distance). \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident from accelera- \n\ntion or braking by Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC \n\nActive Distance Assist DISTRONIC may accel- erate or brake in the following cases, for exam- ple: R If the vehicle pulls away using Active Dis- \n\ntance Assist DISTRONIC. \n\nR If the stored speed is called up and is con- siderably faster or slower than the cur- rently driven speed. \n\nR If Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC no longer detects a vehicle in front or does not react to relevant objects. \n\n# Always carefully observe the traffic con- \n\nditions and be ready to brake at all times. \n\nR Depending on the vehicle mass detected, the dynamics of the DISTRONIC intervention are reduced. \n\n# Take into account the traffic situation before calling up the stored speed. \n\nR Rapid acceleration to the stored speed is initi- ated if the turn signal indicator is switched on to change to the overtaking lane. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to insuffi- cient deceleration by Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC \n\nActive Distance Assist DISTRONIC is only an aid. The driver is responsible for the distance to the vehicle in front, for vehicle speed and for braking in good time. \n\nSystem limits \n\nThe system may be impaired or may not function in the following situations, forexample: R The radar sensors are disturbed by snow, rain, fog, heavy spray, glare, direct sunlight or highly variable light conditions. \n\nActive Distance Assist DISTRONIC brakes your vehicle with up to 50% of the possible deceler- ation. If this deceleration is not sufficient, Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC alerts you with a visual and acoustic warning. # Adjust your speed and maintain a suita- ble distance from the vehicle in front. # Brake the vehicle yourself and/or take \n\nevasive action. \n\nR The radar sensors may malfunction in parking garages or on roads with steep uphill or down- hill gradients. \n\nR If the radar sensors are dirty or covered. \n\n154 Driving and parking \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident if detection function of Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is impaired \n\nR The seat occupancy recognition on the driver's seat has detected that the driver has fastened the seat belt. \n\nActive Distance Assist DISTRONIC does not react or has a limited reaction: R when driving on a different lane or when \n\nR The check of the radar sensor system has been \n\nsuccessfully completed. \n\nActivating Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC \n\nchanging lanes \n\nR to pedestrians, animals, bicycles or station- ary vehicles, or unexpected obstacles \n\nR to complex traffic conditions R to oncoming vehicles and crossing traffic \n\nAs a result, Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC may neither give warnings nor intervene in such situations. # Always observe the traffic conditions carefully and react accordingly. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to Active Speed Limit Assist adapting the vehicle's speed \n\nThe speed adopted by Active Speed Limit Assist may be too high or incorrect in some individual cases, such as: R at speed limits below 12 mph (20 km/h) R in wet conditions or in fog R when towing a trailer \n\n# Press button 1. # To activate without a stored speed: push rocker \n\nswitch 3 up M or down N.

It monitors the area around your vehicle using six sensors in the front bumper and six sensors in the rear bumper. Parking Assist PARKTRONIC indicates vis- ually and audibly the distance between your vehi- cle and an object. For vehicles with rear attachments or selected open vehicle model designations, there is special equipment without rear sensors. Here, the six sen- sors in the rear bumper are omitted. For the rear area and the side area, no distances to an obstacle are displayed and no optical warnings or warning tones are given. Parking Assist PARKTRONIC is only an aid. It is not a substitute for your attention to the surroundings. You are always responsible for safe maneuvering, parking and exiting a parking space. Make sure that there are no persons, animals or objects etc. \n\nDriving and parking 157 \n\nin the maneuvering area while maneuvering and parking or exiting parking spaces. In the standard setting, an intermittent warning tone sounds from a distance of approximately 1.3 ft (0.4 m) to an obstacle. A continuous warning tone sounds from a distance of approximately 1.0 ft (0.3 m). You can set the warning tone in the multimedia system so that it will sound earlier at a greater distance of approximately 3.3 ft (1 m) (/ page 157). \n\nParking Assist PARKTRONIC display in the multi- media system If the Parking Assist PARKTRONIC display is not active and an obstacle is detected in the path of the vehicle, a pop-up window for Parking Assist PARKTRONIC appears at speeds of up to approx- imately 6 mph (10 km/h). \n\nMultimedia system: 4 ©  5 Settings  5 Quick Access # Select PARKTRONIC On. \n\nThe function is activated or deactivated depending on the previous setting. \n\n% Parking Assist PARKTRONIC is automatically \n\nactivated when starting the vehicle. \n\n▌Setting the warning tones of Parking Assist PARKTRONIC Multimedia system: 4 Settings  5 Assistance 5 Camera & Parking  5 Set Warning Tones \n\nAdjusting the volume of the warning tones # Select Warning Tone Volume. # Adjust the value. \n\nSystem limits \n\nParking Assist PARKTRONIC does not necessarily take into account the following obstacles: R Obstacles below the detection range, e.g. per- \n\nsons, animals or objects \n\nR Obstacles above the detection range, e.g. over- hanging loads, overhangs or loading ramps of trucks \n\nThe sensors must be free of dirt, ice and slush.

Blind Spot Assist cannot warn drivers in these situations. # Always pay careful attention to the traffic situation and maintain a safe distance at the side of the vehicle. \n\n% An exit warning is not issued for sliding doors \n\nand rear-end doors. \n\nOverview \n\nWhen the vehicle is stationary, an object is detected from behind in the detection range. \n\nRed warning lamp in the outside mirror \n\nBlind Spot Assist is only an aid. It may fail to detect some vehicles and is no substitute for attentive driving. Ensure that there is sufficient distance to the side from other road users and obstacles. If a vehicle is detected above speeds of approx- imately 7.5 mph (12 km/h) and this vehicle subse- quently enters the detection range directly next to your vehicle, the warning lamp in the outside mir- ror lights up red. % When a trailer is connected, the radar sensor's field of vision may be impaired, thereby mak- ing limited monitoring possible. Always pay careful attention to the traffic situation and maintain a safe distance at the side of the vehicle. \n\nIf a vehicle is detected close to your vehicle in the lateral detection range and you switch on the turn signal indicator in the corresponding direction, a warning tone sounds. The red warning lamp in the outside mirror flashes. If the turn signal indicator remains switched on, all other detected vehicles are indicated only by the flashing of the red warn- ing lamp. If you overtake a vehicle quickly, no warning is given. \n\nExit warning The exit warning is an additional function of Blind Spot Assist and warns vehicle occupants when leaving the vehicle about any approaching vehicles. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident despite exit \n\nwarning \n\nThe exit warning neither reacts to stationary objects nor to persons or road users approach- ing you at a greatly differing speed. The exit warning cannot warn drivers in these situations. # Always pay particular attention to the \n\ntraffic situation when opening the doors \n\nWhen the vehicle is stationary, a door on the relevant side of the vehicle is opened. An object which is close to your vehicle is detected in the detec- tion range. \n\n% This additional function is only available when Blind Spot Assist is activated and up to a maxi- mum of three minutes after the drive system has been switched off. The end of the availa- bility of the exit warning function is indicated by a series of flashes in the outside mirror. The exit warning function is only an aid and is no substitute for the attentiveness of the vehicle occupants. Responsibility lies with the vehicle occupants when opening doors and leaving the vehicle. \n\nSystem limits \n\nBlind Spot Assist and the exit warning function may be limited in the following situations: R if there is dirt on the sensors or the sensors \n\nare obscured \n\nR if there is poor visibility, e.g. due to fog, heavy \n\nrain, snow or spray \n\nR if narrow vehicles are within the detection \n\nrange, e.g. bicycles R if lanes are very wide R if lanes are very narrow R if vehicles are not driving in the middle of their \n\nlane \n\n% Stationary or slow-moving objects are not dis- \n\nplayed. \n\nCollision warning \n\nWarnings may be issued in error when driving close to crash barriers or similar solid lane bor- ders.

There is a risk of fatal injuries. # Install and secure the ball neck as descri- bed in the ball neck manufacturer's installation instructions. \n\n# If a ball neck is installed, ensure sure \n\nthat it is properly secured before every journey. \n\nWhen backing up the towing vehicle, ensure that there is no one between the vehicle and the trailer. If you do not couple the trailer to the towing vehi- cle correctly, the trailer may become detached. Once it has been coupled and is roadworthy, the trailer must be in a horizontal position behind the towing vehicle. Note the following regarding the tongue weight: R Make full use of the maximum tongue weight, \n\nwhere possible. \n\nR Never fall below a legally prescribed minimum tongue weight; the tongue weight must always be positive. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to a ball \n\nneck that is not correctly installed or secured \n\nR Do not exceed or fall below the permissible \n\ntongue weights – this must be observed during loading and unloading of the trailer. \n\nIf the ball neck is not correctly installed and secured, the trailer may come loose. # Install and secure the ball neck as descri- bed in the ball neck manufacturer's installation instructions. \n\n# If a ball neck is installed, ensure sure \n\nthat it is properly secured before every journey. \n\n* NOTE Wearing out the brake linings by \n\ncontinuously depressing the brake pedal \n\n# Do not depress the brake pedal continu- \n\nously whilst driving. \n\n# To use the braking effect of the engine, shift to a lower gear in good time. \n\n* NOTE The operating permit may be invali- dated due to the illegal installation of trailer hitches \n\nThe installation – including retrofitting – of a non-folding or non-removable trailer hitch that even partially conceals the license plate or the lighting system is prohibited. # Observe the applicable legal regulations for the installation of trailer hitches. \n\nBe sure to comply with the operating instructions of the manufacturer of the trailer coupling and the ball neck. Place your vehicle/trailer combination on surfaces that are as even as possible and secure it against rolling away (/ page 140). Couple and uncouple the trailer carefully. \n\nDo not exceed the following values: R Permitted braked or unbraked towing capacity The maximum permissible towing capacity for unbraked trailers is 1,653 lbs (750 kg). \n\nR Permissible rear axle load of the towing vehicle R Permissible gross weight of the towing vehicle R Permissible gross weight of the trailer R Permissible gross combination weight R Maximum permissible speed of the trailer \n\nThe relevant permitted values, which must not be exceeded, can be found in the following places: R In your vehicle documents R On the identification plate of the trailer hitch R On the trailer's identification plate R On the vehicle identification plate \n\nIf there are discrepancies between the values, the lowest one shall apply. Before driving off, ensure the following: R The tire pressure on the rear axle of the towing vehicle has been set for the maximum load. \n\nR The headlamps have been set correctly. \n\nValues approved by the manufacturer can be found on the identification plates and in the section for the towing vehicle (/ page 246). Your vehicle will behave differently with a trailer than without: R The vehicle/trailer combination will be heavier. R The vehicle/trailer combination will be restric- \n\nted in its acceleration and gradeability. \n\n172 Driving and parking \n\nR The vehicle/trailer combination will have an \n\nincreased braking distance. \n\nR The vehicle/trailer combination will be more \n\nsusceptible to crosswind gusts. \n\nR The vehicle/trailer combination will require \n\nmore sensitive steering. \n\nR The vehicle/trailer combination will have a \n\nlarger turning circle. \n\nYou will therefore make use of the engine's braking effect and will not have to brake as often to control the speed. This will take some of the strain off the brake system and prevent the brakes from over- heating and wearing too quickly. If you need addi- tional braking, depress the brake pedal intermit- tently rather than continuously. Observe the notes on ESP® trailer stabilization (/ page 147). \n\nThis may impair the vehicle's driving characteris- tics. When driving with a vehicle/trailer combination, always adapt your speed to the current road and weather conditions. Drive carefully. Keep a suffi- cient safe distance. Comply with the maximum permissible speed of 50 mph (80 km/h) or 62 mph (100 km/h), even in countries in which higher speeds are permitted for vehicle/trailer combinations. Attach only an approved trailer hitch to your vehi- cle. Use only a ball neck that has been approved for your vehicle. Further information about availa- bility and installation – including that of the trailer electrics – is available from a qualified specialist workshop. The trailer hitch is one of the most important vehi- cle parts for road safety. Comply with the instruc- tions on operation, maintenance and servicing in the manufacturer's operating instructions. % Your vehicle's bumpers are not suitable for \n\nDriving tips \n\nIf the trailer starts to sway, remember the following points: R Do not accelerate under any circumstances. R Do not countersteer. R If necessary, apply the brakes. \n\n% You can reduce the risk of the trailer swaying and rocking by retrofitting stabilizer bars or trailer stability programs. Further information is available from any authorized Mercedes- Benz Center. \n\nWhen you are driving with a trailer, observe the fol- lowing points: R Maintain a greater distance from the vehicle in \n\nfront than when driving without a trailer. \n\nR Avoid braking abruptly. If possible, brake gently first of all so that the trailer closes up behind your vehicle. Then, increase the brake force rapidly. \n\ninstalling detachable trailer hitches. Do not attach any rented trailer hitches or any other detachable trailer hitches to the bumpers. % During trailer operation, remember that \n\nPARKTRONIC is available only to a limited extent, if at all. \n\nR The values given for start-off gradeability refer to sea level. When driving in mountainous areas, note that engine output – and thus start-off gradeability – will decrease with increasing elevation. \n\n% The height of the ball head will change \n\nCoupling/uncoupling a trailer \n\ndepending on the vehicle's load.

Most US states and all Canadian provinces pre- scribe the following points, and you are urgently recommended to comply with these: R Safety chains between the towing vehicle and the trailer. The chains should be routed in a criss-cross pattern under the drawbar. They must be connected to the trailer hitch and not to the bumper or to the vehicle's axle. Leave sufficient slack in the chains. This also allows for sharp cornering. \n\nR A separate brake system is required for certain \n\ntrailers. \n\nR A safety feature is required for braked trailers. Determine the specific requirements according to the relevant laws. If the trailer becomes detached from the tow- ing vehicle, the safety feature triggers the trailer brakes and can thus reduce the danger. \n\nUncoupling a trailer \n\n& WARNING Risk of being crushed and becoming trapped when uncoupling a trailer \n\nWhen uncoupling a trailer with an engaged inertia-activated brake, your hand may become trapped between the vehicle and the trailer drawbar. # Do not uncouple trailers with an engaged \n\noverrun brake. \n\nDo not uncouple a trailer with an inertia-activated brake in a state of overrun. Otherwise, the rebound of the inertia-activated brake can damage your vehicle. \n\nInformation about towing a trailer \n\nOperating a trailer is subject to many statutory regulations such as speed restrictions. Many states also require an auxiliary separate functional braking system when towing a weight that exceeds a certain limit. For your safety, it is recommended to use a separate functional braking system on any towed vehicle. Make sure that your trailer combination meets local regulations. This not only applies to your place of residence, but also to your destination. Information on this can be obtained from the police and local authorities. Comply with the following when driving with a trailer: R Practice cornering, stopping and backing up in a traffic-free location. In this way, you will gain driving experience and become accustomed to the new handling characteristics. R Before driving, check the following: \n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\nthat the trailer tow hitch and ball coupling are secure that the safety switch for braked trailers is functioning correctly that the safety chains are secure and undamaged that the electrical connections are secure that the lights are functioning correctly the wheels for damage and correct tire pressure (/ page 243) \n\nR Adjust the outside mirrors so that you have a clear view of the rear section of the trailer. R If the trailer is equipped with an individual brak- ing system, check before each journey whether the brakes are functioning correctly. R If the trailer has electronically controlled \n\nbrakes, pull away carefully with the vehicle/ trailer combination. Brake manually using the \n\n174 Driving and parking \n\nbrake controller and check whether the brakes are functioning correctly. \n\nR Secure the load on the trailer in line with the \n\nPermissible trailer loads and tongue weights \n\nWeight information \n\nrequirements and rules for load-securing meth- ods. \n\nR When driving with a trailer, check at regular intervals that the load is secure and that the lights and brakes are functioning correctly. R Bear in mind that the handling characteristics are more unstable when towing a trailer than when driving without a trailer. Avoid sudden steering movements. \n\nR The vehicle/trailer combination is heavier, \n\naccelerates more slowly, has a reduced climb- ing ability and an increased braking distance. It is more susceptible to side winds and requires careful steering. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to an \n\nunbraked trailer with an excessive gross weight \n\nIf you pull an unbraked trailer with a gross trailer weight (GTW) of more than 1,653 lbs (750 kg), the vehicle's brake system may over- heat. This increases the braking distance and may even cause the brake system to fail. # Always use a trailer with a separate brak- ing system if you are pulling a gross trailer weight (GTW) of more than 1,653 lbs (750 kg). \n\nR If possible, do not brake suddenly, but rather moderately at first so that the trailer can acti- vate its brakes. Then increase the pressure on the brake pedal. \n\n* NOTE Damage to the drive train, transmis- sion or trailer tow hitch due to excess gross combination weight \n\nR If the automatic transmission shifts between gears on uphill or downhill gradients, restrict the shift range. Select shift range 4, 3, 2 or 1. A lower gear and reduced speed decrease the risk of engine damage. \n\nThe permissible gross combination weight is exceeded. The drive train, the transmission or the trailer tow hitch may be damaged. # Comply with the permissible gross com- \n\nR When driving on a downhill gradient, shift to a lower gear to use the engine's braking effect. Avoid constant braking, as this could cause the vehicle brakes and possibly also the trailer brakes to overheat. \n\nR If the coolant temperature increases signifi- cantly when the air-conditioning system is switched on, switch the air-conditioning sys- tem off. Coolant heat can also be dissipated by switch- ing the airflow and the temperature of the heater or air conditioning to the maximum level. Open the windows if necessary. R When overtaking, pay particular attention to \n\nthe increased overtaking distance of your vehi- cle/trailer combination. Due to the length of your vehicle/trailer combi- nation you will require a longer stretch of road before switching back to the original lane. \n\nbination weight. \n\nIn vehicles with a permissible gross vehicle weight of 11030 lbs (5003 kg), the permissible gross combination weight is less than the sum of the per- missible gross vehicle weight plus the permissible trailer load. If either the vehicle or the trailer is fully laden, the permitted gross vehicle weight or the permitted trailer load values will be reduced accordingly. In this case, you may only partially load the trailer or the vehicle. The gross trailer weight (GTW) is calculated on the basis of the weight of the trailer plus the weight of its load and equipment. If the trailer is equipped with a separate braking system, then the maximum gross trailer weight is 5000 lbs (2268 kg) or 7500 lbs (3402 kg). The maximum permissible drawbar tongue weight on the ball head is 500 lbs (227 kg) or 750 lbs (340 kg). However, the actual tongue weight must not exceed the value given on the trailer hitch or trailer identification plates. Where the values differ, the lowest shall always apply. The gross combined weight rating (GCWR) is calcu- lated on the basis of the gross trailer weight plus the gross vehicle weight, including a driver's \n\nDriving and parking 175 \n\nweight of approximately 150 lbs (68 kg). The maxi- mum permissible gross combination weight is vehi- cle-specific and equipment-dependent. When driv- ing with a trailer, you should not exceed the maxi- mum permissible gross combination weight rating (GCWR). The permissible values, which must not be excee- ded, can be found in your vehicle documents and on the identification plates of the trailer hitch, the trailer and the vehicle. The values approved by the manufacturer can also be found in the \"Technical data\" section. Where the values differ, the lowest shall always apply. \n\nLoading the trailer Use a tongue weight that is as close as possible to the maximum permissible tongue weight. Do not allow the weight to fall below the minimum permis- sible tongue weight. Otherwise, the trailer may become detached. R Distribute the load over the vehicle and the \n\ntrailer so as not to exceed either the maximum permissible values for the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) and gross trailer weight (GTW), the gross combination weight rating (GCWR), or the maximum permissible gross axle weight rating (GAWR) and tongue weight (TWR) of your vehicle. \n\nTrailer power supply \n\nIncorrect cabling of the connector plug may inter- fere with other electronic systems in the vehicle. Mercedes-Benz therefore recommends that you have the cabling of the connector plug carried out at a qualified specialist workshop. You can connect accessories up to a maximum of 240 W to the permanent power supply. Do not charge a trailer battery using the power supply. Your vehicle may be equipped with a range of elec- trical equipment for trailer operation. Depending on your trailer, you may need an adapter for the electrical connection between the trailer and your vehicle. The trailer socket of your vehicle is equipped with a permanent power supply at the factory. The permanent power supply is supplied via trailer socket pin 4. Note that the trailer's permanent power supply is not switched off when the vehicle's on-board elec- trical system voltage is low. This could completely discharge your vehicle's starter battery. Further information on the electrical equipment currently installed on your vehicle and on installing the trailer electrics can be obtained at a qualified specialist workshop. \n\nR Add the drawbar tongue weight (TWR) on the \n\nball head to the rear axle load. This will ensure that you do not exceed the permissible gross axle weight rating (GAWR). \n\nR Add the vehicle load to the drawbar tongue \n\nweight (TWR) on the ball head. This will ensure that you do not exceed the permissible gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). \n\nChecking vehicle and trailer weight R Make sure that the weights of the towing vehi- cle and the trailer comply with the maximum permissible values. Have the vehicle/trailer combination weighed on a calibrated weighing machine. The vehicle/trailer combination com- prises the towing vehicle including driver, pas- sengers and load as well as the laden trailer.

Exhaust gases can enter the vehicle interior if the rear- end door is open when the engine is running, especially if the vehicle is in motion. # Always switch off the engine before \n\nopening the rear-end door. \n\nstarting a journey. \n\n# Stow and secure objects that are heavy, hard, pointed, sharp-edged, fragile or too large in the cargo compartment. \n\n& WARNING Risk of burns from the tailpipe \n\nand tailpipe trims \n\n# Never drive with the rear-end door open. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury from unsecured \n\nobjects in the vehicle \n\nWhen objects are unsecured or inadequately secured, they can slip, tip over or be thrown about, striking vehicle occupants. This also applies to: R Luggage or loads R Seats which have been removed and are being transported in the vehicle in an exceptional case \n\nThere is a risk of injury, particularly in the event of braking maneuvers or abrupt changes in direction. # Always stow objects in such a way that \n\nthey cannot be tossed about. \n\n# Before traveling, secure objects, luggage or load to prevent them slipping or tip- ping over. \n\n# When a seat is removed, keep it prefera- \n\nbly outside the vehicle. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury due to objects \n\nbeing stowed incorrectly \n\nIf objects in the vehicle interior are stowed incorrectly, they can slide or be thrown around and hit vehicle occupants. In addition, cup holders, open storage spaces and mobile phone receptacles cannot always retain all objects within. There is a risk of injury, particularly in the event of sudden braking or abrupt changes in direction. # Always store objects such that they can- not be thrown around in such situations. \n\nThe exhaust tailpipe and tailpipe trims can become very hot. If you come into contact with these parts of the vehicle, you could burn your- self. # Always be particularly careful around the tailpipe and the tailpipe trims and super- vise children especially closely in this area. \n\n# Allow vehicle parts to cool down before \n\ntouching them. \n\nIf you are using a roof luggage rack, please note the maximum roof load and the maximum load capacity of the roof luggage rack (/ page 288). Camera-based driving systems and the sensor functions of the inside rear-view mirror may be impaired if you are transporting a load on the roof and it protrudes more than 16 in (40 cm) over the front edge of the roof. Therefore, make sure that the load does not overhang by more than 16 in (40 cm). The handling characteristics of your vehicle are dependent on the load distribution. Therefore, please observe the following notes when loading: R when transporting a load, never exceed the permissible gross mass or the gross axle weight rating for the vehicle (including occu- pants). The values are specified on the vehicle identification plate on the B-pillar. \n\nR the load must not protrude above the upper \n\nedge of the seat backrests. \n\nR if possible, always transport the load in the \n\ncargo compartment. \n\nR fasten the load to the tie-down eyes and dis- \n\ntribute the load evenly among them. \n\nR use tie-down eyes and fastening components which are suitable for the weight and size of the load. \n\nTransporting 209 \n\nNotes on distributing the load within the vehicle \n\nSecuring loads \n\n* NOTE Risk of damage to the floor covering \n\nNotes on load securing \n\nExcessive point loading on the cargo compart- ment floor or on the load area can negatively affect the driving characteristics and could damage the floor covering. # Vehicles with rear-wheel drive: distribute the load uniformly. When doing so, ensure that the overall center of gravity of the load is always as low and close to the center as possible and between the axles near the rear axle. \n\n# Vehicles with all-wheel drive: distribute the load uniformly. When doing so, ensure that the overall center of gravity of the load is always as low and close to the center as possible and between the axles. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident and injury due to incorrect use of the lashing straps \n\nThe following can occur: R The tie-down eyes may detach or the lash- ing strap may tear if the permissible load is exceeded \n\nR The load cannot be restrained \n\nThe load can slip, tip over or be flung about, striking vehicle occupants. # Always tension the lashing straps in the proper manner and only between the described tie-down eyes. \n\n# Always use lashing straps designed spe- \n\ncifically for the loads. \n\nFor Cargo Vans, buses and Passenger Vans: R Always transport loads in the cargo compart- \n\nment. \n\nR Always place the load against the seat backr- \n\nests of the rear bench seat. \n\nR Move large and heavy loads as far towards the front of the vehicle as possible in the direction of travel against the rear bench seat. Stow loads flush with the rear bench seat. \n\nR Always additionally secure the load with suita- \n\nble load securing aids or tie downs. \n\nR The load must not protrude above the upper \n\nedge of the seat backrests. \n\nR Transport loads behind seats that are not \n\noccupied. \n\nR If the rear bench seat is not occupied, insert the seat belts crosswise into the seat belt buckle of the opposite seat belt. \n\n% Observe the information relating to the maxi- mum loading capacity of the individual cargo tie-down points. If you combine various cargo tie-down points to secure a load, always take the maximum loading capacity of the weakest cargo tie-down point into account. During maximum full-stop braking, forces may act which can multiply the weight of the load. Always use several cargo tie-down points to distribute the load. Spread the load evenly between the cargo tie-down points or tie-down eyes. \n\nObserve the Operating Instructions or the lashing strap manufacturer's instructions for the operation of the lashing strap. Observe the information relating to the maximum loading capacity of the cargo tie-down points (/ page 287). As the driver, you are responsible for ensuring the following: R The load is secured against slipping, tipping, \n\nrolling or falling off. Take usual traffic conditions as well as swerv- ing or full brake application and bad roads into account. \n\nR The applicable requirements and guidelines relating to load-securing practices are met. If this is not the case, this may constitute a punishable offense, depending on local legisla- tion and any ensuing consequences. Observe country-specific laws. \n\n210 Transporting \n\nMake sure that the load is secure before every journey and at regular intervals during a long jour- ney. Adjust the load securing as necessary. Infor- mation on how to secure loads correctly can be obtained from the manufacturers of the load securing aids or tie downs for load securing, for example. When securing loads, observe the following: R Fill spaces between the load and the cargo \n\nOverview of cargo tie-down point \n\ncompartment walls or wheel wells. For this pur- pose, use rigid load securing aids, such as chocks, wooden fixings or padding. \n\nR Attach secured and stabilized loads in all direc- \n\ntions. Use the cargo tie-down points or tie-down eyes and the loading rails in the cargo compart- ment. Only use tie downs, such as lashing rods, lock rods or lashing nets and lashing straps, which have been tested in accordance with current standards (e.g. DIN EN). Always use the cargo tie-down points closest to the load and pad sharp edges. Loads, and heavy loads in particular, should preferably be secured using the tie-down eyes. \n\n% You can obtain tie downs tested in accordance with current standards (e.g. DIN EN) from any specialist company or from a qualified special- ist workshop. \n\nNotes on the partition Without a partition, vehicles that are approved as commercial vehicles (vehicle category N1, N2) do not fulfill standard ISO 27956, which describes the equipment for properly securing a load in delivery vehicles. If the vehicle is used to transport goods, retrofitting the partition is strongly recommended, as properly securing the load in vehicles without a partition will always be a complex operation. % Nothing may be stowed in the area between the rear side of the seats and the partition. \n\nCargo tie-down points (example: cargo van without loading rails) 1 Cargo tie-down rings \n\nSecure loose loads with an approved lashing net or a tarp. Always fasten the lashing net or tarp to all available cargo tie-down points. Make sure that the fasten- ing hooks are secured against accidental opening. If your vehicle is equipped with loading rails in the cargo floor, you can place lashing rods directly in front of and behind the load. The lashing rods directly absorb the potential shifting forces. Securing loads on the cargo floor by lashing them down is recommended only for lightweight loads. Lay anti-slip mats under the load to assist in secur- ing it. \n\nInstalling and removing cargo tie-down rings \n\n# To install: slide the cargo tie-down ring through a recess in the loading rail close to the load until the locking mechanism engages in the recess. \n\n% When you pull the locking mechanism up and out of the recess, the cargo tie-down ring is able to move within the loading rail. Make sure that the locking mechanism is always engaged in a recess. \n\n# Check the cargo tie-down ring for firm seating. # To remove: pull the locking mechanism up and pull the cargo tie-down ring towards the lock- ing mechanism and out of the loading rail through a recess. \n\nTransporting 211 \n\nCarrier systems \n\nInformation on the roof luggage rack \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury if maximum roof \n\nload is exceeded \n\nObserve the following points for installing roof lug- gage racks: R Tighten the screws of the roof luggage rack to a torque of 6.0 lb-ft (8 Nm) – 7.4 lb-ft (10 Nm) in the designated sliding blocks. \n\nThe vehicle center of gravity and the usual driv- ing characteristics as well as the steering and braking characteristics will change. If you exceed the maximum roof load, the driv- ing characteristics, as well as the steering and braking characteristics, will be greatly impaired. # Always comply with the maximum roof load and adjust your driving style. \n\nR The tightened screws should not touch the \n\nrails. \n\nR Ensure that the sliding blocks are not located \n\nin the areas around the plastic caps. \n\nR The sliding blocks must have the right cross- \n\nsection. \n\nR The insides of the mounting rails must be free \n\nof dirt. \n\nR Re-tighten the screws uniformly after around \n\n300 miles (500 km). \n\n* NOTE Vehicle damage due to failure to \n\nobserve the maximum permissible clear- ance height \n\nIf the vehicle height is greater than the maxi- mum permitted clearance height, the roof and other parts of the vehicle may be damaged. # Observe the signposted clearance \n\nheight. \n\n# If the vehicle height is greater than the \n\nclearance height, do not enter. # Note the changed vehicle height with \n\nroof mountings. \n\nMercedes-Benz recommends that you use only roof luggage racks that have been tested and approved for Mercedes-Benz. These help to pre- vent vehicle damage. Have mounting rails retrofitted only at a qualified specialist workshop. Otherwise, you could damage the vehicle. If your vehicle is equipped with mounting rails on the roof, you can install a roof luggage rack on the roof. Special fasteners (sliding blocks) are available as accessories for this purpose. These fasteners are available from any authorized Mercedes-Benz Center. \n\nPlacing a load on the wheel arch Comply with the important safety notes under \"Notes on loading\" (/ page 208). \n\n1 Mounting rails \n\nInformation about the maximum roof load can be found in the \"Technical data\" section (/ page 288). \n\n# Place the objects on wheel arch 2 and lash them using tie-down eyes 1(/ page 210). \n\n212 Transporting \n\n% A wheel arch may be subjected to a load of \n\n330 lb (150 kg). \n\nMaintenance and care 213 \n\nASSYST PLUS service interval display \n\nFunction of the ASSYST PLUS service interval dis- play \n\nExamples of arduous operating conditions: R Regular city driving with frequent intermediate \n\nstops \n\nThe ASSYST PLUS service interval display on the instrument cluster provides information on the remaining time or distance before the next service due date.

This feature can help save lives in the event of an accident. eCall in no way replaces assistance provided from dialing 911. eCall only functions in areas where mobile phone coverage is available from the wireless service pro- viders. Insufficient network coverage from the wireless service providers may result in an emer- gency call not being transmitted. eCall is a standard feature in your Mercedes-Benz vehicle. In order to function as intended, the sys- tem relies on the transmission of data detailed in the Transmitted Data section that follows (/ page 228). To disable eCall, a customer must visit an authorized Mercedes-Benz Service depart- ment to deactivate the vehicle's communication module. Deactivation of this module prevents the activa- tion of any and all Mercedes me connect services.  After the deactivation of eCall, automatic emer- gency call and manual emergency call will not be  available. The ignition must be switched on before an auto- matic emergency call can be made. % eCall is activated at the factory. % eCall can be deactivated by an authorized \n\nMercedes-Benz dealer. Please note that in the event ownership of the vehicle is transferred to another owner in its deactivated state, eCall will remain deactivated unless the new owner visits an authorized Mercedes-Benz dealership to reactivate the system. \n\nRemoving the first-aid kit (soft sided) \n\nOverview of the emergency call system \n\nThe first-aid kit (soft sided) is located in the stow- age compartment in the front passenger door. # Remove first-aid (soft sided) kit from the stow- \n\nage compartment. \n\nRemoving the warning lamp \n\nThe warning lamp is located in the stowage com- partment in the front-passenger door. # Remove the warning lamp from the stowage \n\ncompartment. \n\neCall can help to reduce the time between an acci- dent and the arrival of emergency services at the site of the accident. It helps locate an accident site in places that are difficult to access. However, even if a vehicle is equipped with eCall, this does not mean the system is ON. As such, eCall does not replace dialing 911 in the event of an accident. An emergency call can be made automatically (/ page 228) or manually (/ page 228). Only make emergency calls if you or others are in need of rescue. Do not make an emergency call in the event of a breakdown or a similar situation. \n\n228 Breakdown assistance \n\nMessage in the media display: SOS NOT READY: the vehicle is not switched on or eCall is not available.

If no signs of dam- age can be detected, have the tires and wheels checked at a qualified specialist workshop. \n\nConduct the following checks regularly on all wheels, at least once a month or as required, e.g. before a long journey or when driving off-road: R check the tire pressure (/ page 245) R check the valve caps \n\nValves must be protected from moisture and dirt with valve caps specifically approved by Mercedes-Benz for your vehicle. \n\nR visually inspect the tread depth and the tire contact surface across the whole tire width The minimum tread depth for summer use is â in (3 mm) and for winter use ã in (4 mm). \n\nNotes on regularly inspecting wheels and tires \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury through damaged \n\ntires \n\nDamaged tires can cause tire pressure loss. # Check the tires regularly for signs of \n\ndamage and replace any damaged tires immediately. \n\nCheck the wheels and tires of your vehicle for damage regularly, i.e. at least every two weeks, as well as after driving off-road or on rough roads. Damaged wheels can cause a loss of tire pressure. Look out for the following types of damage, for example: R cuts in the tires R punctures in the tires R tears in the tires R bulges on tires R deformation or severe corrosion on wheels \n\n& WARNING Risk of hydroplaning due to \n\ninsufficient tire tread \n\nInsufficient tire tread will result in reduced tire grip. # Thus, you should regularly check the tread depth and the condition of the tread across the entire width of all tires. \n\nMarkings 1 show in which places the bar indica- tors (arrow) are integrated into the tire tread. They are visible as soon as the tread depth is approx- imately á in (1.6 mm). \n\nInformation on driving with summer tires At temperatures below 50 °F (10 °C) summer tires lose elasticity and therefore traction and braking power. Change the tires on your vehicle to M+S tires. Using summer tires at very cold tempera- tures could cause tears to form, thereby damaging the tires permanently. Mercedes-Benz cannot accept responsibility for this type of damage. Always observe the maximum permissible speed specified for the summer tires you have installed (/ page 256). Once you have installed the summer tires: R Check the tire pressure (/ page 245) R Restart the tire pressure monitor \n\n(/ page 251) \n\nMinimum tread depth for: R Summer tires: â in (3 mm) R M+S tires: ã in (4 mm) \n\n# For safety reasons, replace the tires \n\nbefore the legally prescribed limit for the minimum tread depth is reached. \n\nInformation on M+S tires At temperatures below 50 °F (10 °C) use winter tires or all-season tires that are marked with M+S. Only winter tires bearing the i snowflake sym- bol in addition to the M+S marking provide the best possible grip in wintry road conditions. \n\n244 Wheels and tires \n\nOnly these tires allow driving safety systems such as ABS and ESP® to also function optimally in win- ter. These tires have been developed specifically for driving in snow. Use M+S tires of the same make and tread on all wheels to maintain safe handling characteristics. Observe the maximum permissible speed specified for the M+S tires you have installed (/ page 256). If you install M+S tires that have a lower maximum permissible speed than the maximum design speed of the vehicle, affix an appropriate warning sign in the driver's field of vision. You can obtain this at a qualified specialist workshop. Once you have installed the M+S tires, take the fol- lowing measures: R check the tire pressure (/ page 245) R restart the tire pressure monitoring system \n\n(/ page 251) \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to snow \n\nchains breaking \n\nIf you drive too fast with snow chains, they can break, injure other persons, and damage the vehicle. # Observe the maximum permissible speed \n\nfor operation with snow chains. \n\n* NOTE Damage to the wheel trim from \n\nmounted snow chains \n\nIf snow chains are mounted to steel wheels, the wheel trims can be damaged. # Remove the wheel trims of steel wheels \n\nbefore mounting snow chains. \n\nObserve the following notes when using snow chains: R Snow chains are only permissible for certain \n\nNotes on snow chains \n\nwheel/tire combinations.

Only check tire pressures when the tires are cold. Conditions for cold tires: R The vehicle has been parked with the tires out of direct sunlight for at least three hours. R The vehicle has traveled less than 1 mile \n\n(1.6 km). \n\nA rise in the tire temperature of 18 °F (10 °C) increases the tire pressure by approx. 10 kPa (0.1 bar/1.5 psi). Take this into account when checking the tire pressure of warm tires. The tire pressures recommended for increased load/speed in the tire pressure table may affect the ride comfort. \n\nThe tire pressure table shows the recommended tire pressure for the tires installed at the factory on this vehicle. The recommended tire pressures are valid for cold tires and different vehicle load condi- tions. If one or more tire sizes precede a tire pressure, the tire pressure information following is only valid for those tire sizes. If the preceding tire sizes are supplemented by the + symbol, the tire pressure information follow- ing shows alternative tire pressures. The load conditions \"partially laden\" and \"fully laden\" are defined in the table for varying weights. Some tire pressure tables only show the rim diam- eter instead of the complete tire size, e.g. R16. The rim diameter is part of the tire size and can be found on the side wall of the tire (/ page 256). \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to unsuita- \n\nble accessories on tire valves \n\nIf you mount unsuitable accessories onto tire valves, the tire valves may be overloaded and malfunction, which can cause tire pressure loss. # Only screw standard valve caps or valve caps specifically approved by Mercedes- Benz for your vehicle onto the tire valve. \n\nNotes on trailer operation Always inflate the tires on the rear axle to the rec- ommended tire pressure on the tire pressure table for a full load. \n\nOverview of the tire pressure table \n\nThe tire pressure table can be found on the seat base or on the B-pillar on the driver's side. % The data shown in the images is example data. \n\nWheels and tires 247 \n\nFront axle tire pressures on vehicles with all-wheel/rear wheel drive and Single tires Max. front axle load 4101 lbs (1860 kg) \n\nTires/disc wheel \n\nVehicle load \n\nMax. front axle load 4101 lbs (1860 kg) \n\nLT245/75R16 120/116Q \n\nFully laden \n\n320 kPa (3.2 bar/46 psi) \n\nFront axle tire pressures on vehicles with rear wheel drive and Single tires Max. front axle load 4409 lbs (2000 kg) \n\nTires/disc wheel \n\nVehicle load \n\nMax. front axle load 4409 lbs (2000 kg) \n\nLT245/75R16 120/116Q \n\nFully laden \n\n360 kPa (3.6 bar/52 psi) 1) \n\n1) Only valid for vehicles with a long wheelbase 171 in (4350 mm) and a permissible gross mass of over 7716 lbs (3.5 t). \n\nRear axle tire pressures on vehicles with all-wheel/rear wheel drive and Single tires Max. rear axle load 5357 lbs (2430 kg) \n\nTires/disc wheel \n\nVehicle load \n\nMax. rear axle load 5357 lbs (2430 kg) \n\nLT245/75R16 120/116Q \n\nFully laden \n\n480 kPa (4.8 bar/70 psi) \n\nLT245/75R16 120/116Q \n\nPartially laden 2) \n\n420 kPa (4.2 bar/61 psi) 2) \n\n2) It is only permissible to use this reduced tire pressure if it can be guaranteed by weighing the vehicle that the rear axle load of 4960 lbs (2250 kg) will not be exceeded.

(If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire \n\ninflation pressure label, you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.) As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pres- sure telltale when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pres- sure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle’s handling and stopping ability. Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver’s responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, \n\n250 Wheels and tires \n\neven if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale. Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approx- imately one minute and then remain continu- ously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunc- tions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. \n\n# \n\nSystem limits \n\nThe system may be impaired or may not function in the following situations: R if the tire pressure has been set incorrectly R if there is a sudden pressure loss caused, for example, by a foreign object penetrating the tire \n\nR if there is a malfunction caused by another \n\nradio signal source \n\nR if there is a change of tire size \n\nBear in mind the following related topic: R Notes on tire pressure (/ page 245) \n\n▌Checking the tire pressure with the tire pressure monitoring system \n\nRequirements:  R The vehicle is switched on. \n\nOn-board computer: 4 Service  5 Tires \n\nThe system checks the pressure and temperature of the tires mounted on the vehicle with the aid of a tire pressure sensor. New tire pressure sensors, e.g. in winter tires, are automatically taught-in during the first journey on which they are used. The tire pressure and the tire temperature are shown on the instrument cluster display (/ page 178). If there is a significant loss of tire pressure, a warning is issued: R via display messages (/ page 303) R via the h warning lamp on the instrument \n\ncluster (/ page 318) \n\nIt is the driver's responsibility to set the tire pres- sure to the recommended cold tire pressure suita- ble for the operating situation. Set the tire pres- sure when the tires are cold using a tire pressure gauge. Note that the correct tire pressure for the current operating situation must first be taught-in to the tire pressure monitoring system. In most cases, the tire pressure monitoring system will automatically update the reference values after you have changed the tire pressure. You can, how- ever, also update the reference values manually by restarting the tire pressure monitoring system (/ page 251). \n\nOne of the following displays appears: R The current tire pressure and tire temperature \n\nof the individual wheels. \n\nInstrument cluster display (color) \n\nR The current tire pressure for each wheel. \n\nInstrument cluster display (black and white) \n\nR Tire pressure will be displayed after driving a  few minutes.: the teach-in process of the sys- \n\nWheels and tires 251 \n\ntem is not yet complete.

For example, if the “XXX” amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb passen- gers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400 - 750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs.) \n\n# Step 5: Determine the combined weight of lug- gage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the availa- ble cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4. \n\n# Step 6: If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, \n\nload from your trailer will be transferred to your \n\nWheels and tires 253 \n\nvehicle.

For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government test track as a tire gra- ded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to var- iations in driving habits, service practices and dif- ferences in road characteristics and climate condi- tions. \n\nTraction grade \n\nInformation on tire quality grades \n\n& DANGER Risk of accident due to inade- \n\nAccording to the requirements of the U.S. Depart- ment of Transportation's \"Uniform Tire Quality Grading Standards\" tire manufacturers must grade their tires using the following three performance factors: \n\nquate traction \n\nThe traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests. # Always adapt your driving style and drive at a speed to suit the prevailing traffic and weather conditions. \n\nWheels and tires 255 \n\n* NOTE Damage to the drivetrain from \n\nwheelspin \n\n% The data shown in the illustration is sample \n\ndata. \n\n# Avoid wheelspin. \n\nThe traction grades – from highest to lowest – are AA, A, B and C. These grades relate to the tire's ability to come to a standstill on a wet pavement under controlled conditions on a specified U.S. government test surface made from asphalt and concrete. \n\nTemperature grade \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident from tire over- \n\nheating and tire failure \n\nExcessive speed, underinflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause excessive heat build-up and possible tire failure. # Observe the recommended tire pressure. # Regularly check the pressure of all the \n\ntires. \n\n# Adjust the tire pressure, if necessary. \n\nThe temperature grades are A (highest grade), B and C. These relate to a tire's resistance to heat and its ability to release heat on a specified test wheel in laboratory tests under controlled condi- tions. Sustained high temperatures can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life. In addition, excessively high temperatures can lead to sudden tire failure. Grade C refers to a per- formance which all passenger vehicle tires must exhibit, according to the U.S. Department of Trans- portation's requirements. \n\nThe TIN is a unique identification number for tires and consists of the following components: R DOT (Department of Transportation): tire sym- bol 1 indicates that the tire complies with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Trans- portation. \n\nR Manufacturer identification code: manufac- \n\nturer identification code 2 provides informa- tion about the tire manufacturer. New tires have a code with two symbols. Retreaded tires have a code with four symbols. For further information about retreaded tires, see (/ page 259). \n\nR Tire size: identifier 3 describes the tire size. R Tire type code: tire type code 4 can be used \n\nby the manufacturer as a code to describe spe- cific characteristics of the tire. \n\nR Date of manufacture: date of manufacture 5 provides information about the age of a tire. The 1st and 2nd numbers indicate the calendar week and the 3rd and 4th numbers indicate the year of manufacture (e.g. \"3208\" refers to the 32nd week of the year 2008). \n\nInformation on maximum tire load \n\nInformation on DOT and TIN (Tire Identification Number) \n\nU.S. tire regulations indicate that every tire manu- facturer or retreader must imprint a TIN in or on the sidewall of each tire produced. \n\n% The data shown in the illustration is sample \n\ndata. \n\nMaximum tire load 1 is the maximum permissible weight for which the tire is approved.

These are made of steel, nylon, polyester and other materials. Bar: metric unit for tire pressure. 14.5038 pounds per square inch (psi) and 100 kilopascals (kPa) are the equivalent of 1 bar. DOT (Department of Transportation): DOT marked tires fulfill the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Average weight of vehicle occupants: the number of occupants for which the vehicle is designed mul- tiplied by 150 lbs (68 kg). Uniform Tire Quality Grading Standards: a uniform standard to grade the quality of tires with regards to tread quality, tire traction and temperature char- acteristics. The quality grading assessment is made by the manufacturer in accordance with test specifications of the U.S. government. The quality grade of a tire is imprinted on the sidewall of the tire. Recommended tire pressure: the recommended tire pressure is the pressure specified for the tires installed on the vehicle at the factory. The Tire and Loading Information placard contains the recommended tire pressures for cold tires, the maximum permissible load and the maximum per- missible vehicle speed. The tire pressure table contains the recommended tire pressure for cold tires under various operating conditions, i.e. loading and/or speed of the vehi- cle. Increased vehicle weight due to optional equip- ment: the combined weight of all standard and optional equipment available for the vehicle, regardless of whether it is actually installed on the vehicle or not. Rim: the part of the wheel on which the tire is installed. GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating): GAWR is the gross axle weight rating. The actual load on an axle \n\n258 Wheels and tires \n\nmust never exceed the Gross Axle Weight Rating. You can find the Gross Axle Weight Rating on the B-pillar on the driver's side. Speed rating: the speed rating is part of the tire identification. It specifies the speed range for which a tire is approved. GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight): the Gross Vehicle Weight comprises the weight of the vehicle includ- ing fuel, tools, the spare wheel, any accessories installed, occupants, luggage and the trailer nose- weight if applicable. The Gross Vehicle Weight must never exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight Rat- ing (GVWR) specified on the B-pillar on the driver's side. GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating): the GVWR is the maximum permitted gross weight of the fully laden vehicle (weight of the vehicle including all accessories, occupants, fuel, luggage and the trailer noseweight if applicable). The Gross Vehicle Weight Rating is specified on the vehicle identifica- tion plate on the B-pillar on the driver's side. Maximum weight of the laden vehicle: the maxi- mum weight is the sum of the vehicle's curb weight, weight of the accessories, maximum load and the weight of optional equipment installed at the factory. Kilopascal (kPa): metric unit for tire pressure. 6.9 kPa are the equivalent of 1 psi. Another unit for tire pressure is bar. 100 kilopascals (kPa) are the equivalent of 1 bar. Curb weight: the weight of a vehicle with standard equipment including the maximum capacity of fuel, oil and coolant. It also includes the air-conditioning system and optional equipment if these are instal- led on the vehicle, but does not include passen- gers or luggage. Maximum tire load: the maximum tire load is the maximum permissible weight in kilograms or lbs for which a tire is approved. Maximum permissible tire pressure: maximum per- missible tire pressure for one tire. Maximum load on one tire: maximum load on one tire. This is calculated by dividing the maximum axle load for one axle by two. PSI (pounds per square inch): standard unit of measurement for tire pressure. Aspect ratio: relationship between tire height and tire width in percent. Tire pressure: pressure inside the tire applying an outward force to every square inch of the tire's surface. The tire pressure is specified in pounds \n\nper square inch (psi), in kilopascal (kPa) or in bar. The tire pressure should only be corrected when the tires are cold. Tire pressure on cold tires: the tires are cold when the vehicle has been parked with the tires out of direct sunlight for at least three hours and the vehicle has been driven less than 1 mile (1.6 km). Tire contact surface: the part of the tire that comes into contact with the road. Tire bead: the purpose of the tire bead is to ensure that the tire sits securely on the wheel rim. There are several wire cores in the tire bead to prevent the tire from changing length on the wheel rim. Side wall: the part of the tire between the tread and the tire bead. Special equipment weight: the combined weight of those optional extras that weigh more than the replaced standard parts and more than 5 lbs (2.3 kg). Special equipment, such as high-perform- ance brakes, level control system, a roof luggage rack or a high-performance battery, are not inclu- ded in the curb weight and the weight of the accessories. TIN (Tire Identification Number): a unique identifi- cation number which can be used by a tire manu- facturer to identify tires, for example in a product recall, and thus identify the purchasers. The TIN is made up of the manufacturer identification code, tire size, tire type code and the manufacturing date. Load-bearing index: the load-bearing index (also load index) is a code that contains the maximum load-bearing capacity of a tire. Traction: traction is the result of friction between the tires and the road surface. Wear indicator: narrow bars (tread wear bars) that are distributed over the tire contact surface. If the tire tread is level with the bars, the wear limit of 1/16 in (1.6 mm) has been reached. Distribution of vehicle occupants: distribution of vehicle occupants over designated seat positions in a vehicle. Maximum permissible payload weight: nominal load and luggage load plus 150 lbs (68 kg) multi- plied by the number of seats in the vehicle. \n\nWheels and tires 259 \n\nChanging a wheel \n\nNotes on selecting, installing and replacing tires \n\nYou can ask for information regarding permitted wheel/tire combinations at a qualified specialist workshop. \n\n& WARNING Risk of accident due to incor- \n\nrect wheel and tire dimensions \n\nIf wheels and tires of the wrong size are used, the service brakes or wheel suspension com- ponents may be damaged. # Always replace wheels and tires with \n\nOtherwise, certain properties, such as han- dling characteristics, vehicle noise emissions and consumption could be adversely affected. Other wheel sizes may cause the tires to come into contact with the vehicle body and axle components when under load. This may result in damage to the tire or the vehicle. # Only use tires, wheels and accessory \n\nparts that have been checked and rec- ommended by Mercedes-Benz. \n\n* NOTE Driving safety put at risk by retrea- \n\nded tires \n\nones that fulfill the specifications of the original part. \n\nFor wheels, pay attention to the following: R Designation R Type R Permissible wheel load R Wheel offset \n\nRetreaded tires are not checked or recommen- ded by Mercedes-Benz, as previous damage is not always detected during the retread proc- ess. Driving safety cannot, therefore, be guaran- teed. # Do not use used tires when their previ- \n\nous usage is unknown. \n\nFor tires, pay attention to the following: R Designation R Manufacturer R Type R Load-bearing index R Speed rating \n\n* NOTE Damage to electronic components \n\ndue to use of installation tools \n\nVehicles with tire pressure monitoring system: electronic components are located in the wheel. # Do not place any installation tools in the \n\narea of the valve. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury through exceeding the specified tire load-bearing capacity or the permissible speed rating \n\n# Only have tires replaced at a qualified \n\nspecialist workshop. \n\nExceeding the specified tire load rating or the permissible speed rating may lead to tire dam- age and to the tires bursting. # Therefore, only use tire types and sizes approved for your vehicle model. # Observe the tire load rating and speed \n\nrating required for your vehicle. \n\n* NOTE Vehicle and tire damage due to tire types and sizes that have not been approved \n\nFor safety reasons, only use tires, wheels and accessory parts which have been specially approved by Mercedes-Benz for your vehicle. These tires have been specially adapted for use with driving systems and driving safety sys- tems, such as ABS or ESP®. \n\nAccessories that are not approved for your vehicle by Mercedes-Benz, or are not being used correctly, can impair operating safety. Before purchasing and using non-approved acces- sories, visit a qualified specialist workshop and inquire about: R suitability R legal stipulations R factory recommendations \n\nObserve the following points when selecting, installing and replacing tires: R Use only tires and wheels of the same type, \n\ndesign (winter tires, all-season tires) and make. \n\nR Only install wheels of the same size and tread \n\ndesign on one axle (left and right). \n\n260 Wheels and tires \n\nIt is only permissible to install a different wheel size to this in the event of a flat tire in order to drive to the specialist workshop. \n\ntires with different dimensions; doing so may lead to the general operating permit being ren- dered invalid. \n\nR Only install tires of the correct size onto the \n\nwheels. \n\nR Vehicles with a tire pressure monitoring sys- \n\ntem: all installed wheels must be equipped with functioning sensors for the tire pressure moni- toring system. \n\nR At temperatures below 50 °F (10 °C) use win- ter tires or all-season tires with the M+S mark- ing on all wheels. Winter tires bearing the i snowflake sym- bol in addition to the M+S marking provide the best possible grip in wintry road conditions. \n\nAlso observe the following further related subjects: R Notes on tire pressure (/ page 245) R Tire and Loading Information placard \n\n(/ page 252) \n\nR Tire size designation, load-bearing capacity \n\nand speed rating (/ page 256) R Tire pressure table (/ page 246) R Notes on the emergency spare wheel \n\n(/ page 266) \n\nNotes on changing wheels \n\nR Only use tires with the same tread. R Observe the maximum permissible speed for \n\nthe installed tires. If this is below the vehicle's maximum permis- sible speed, this must be indicated in an appro- priate label in the driver's field of vision. R Break in new tires at moderate speeds for the \n\nfirst 60 miles (100 km). \n\nR Replace the tires after six years at the latest, \n\nregardless of wear. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury through different \n\nwheel sizes \n\nRotating the front and rear wheels can severely impair the driving characteristics. The wheel brakes or suspension components may also be damaged. # Rotate front and rear wheels only if the wheels and tires are of the same dimen- sions. \n\nFor more information on wheels and tires, contact a qualified specialist workshop. % Vehicles with twin tires: \n\nFor vehicles with twin tires with a GVW of 11,030 lbs or 12,125 lbs, only use tires with the dimension LT 215/85 R16 which have been approved for this vehicle by the manufac- turer. It is not permissible to use tires with dif- ferent dimensions; doing so may lead to the general operating permit being rendered inva- lid. \n\n% Vehicles with single tires: \n\nOn vehicles that have the same size front and rear wheels, rotate the wheels according to the inter- vals in the tire manufacturer's warranty book in your vehicle documents. If this is not available, rotate the tires every 3,000 (5,000) to 6,000 miles (10,000 km), depending on the degree of wear. Ensure that the direction of rotation is maintained. It is imperative to observe the instructions and safety notes on \"Changing a wheel\" when doing so. \n\nSize categories of wheels \n\nFor vehicles with single tires with a GVW less than or equal to 9,480 lbs, only use tires with the dimension LT 245/75 R16 which have been approved for this vehicle by the manufac- turer. It is not permissible to use tires with dif- ferent dimensions; doing so may lead to the general operating permit being rendered inva- lid. \n\n% Vehicles with Super Single tires: \n\nFor vehicles with single tires with a GVW of 11,030 lbs, only use tires with the dimensions 225/75 R16C (FA) and 285/65 R16C (RA) which have been approved for this vehicle by the manufacturer. It is not permissible to use \n\nThe determined vehicle speed is displayed in the instrument cluster and is important for controlling the driving safety systems and driving systems. The display accuracy of the speedometer and the odometer is legally prescribed. Determining the speed is dependent on the tire size or the rolling circumference of the tires. The rim diameter is always specified in inches. For this reason, the vehicle control units can be coded for the following wheel size categories: Wheel size category 3 R 205/75 R16C FA R 225/75 R16C FA \n\nWheels and tires 261 \n\nR 285/65 R16C RA R LT245/75 R16 R LT215/85 R16 \n\n% Mercedes-Benz recommends that you stay \n\nwithin a wheel size category when changing a tire. In this way, you avoid recoding the control units. \n\n% You will find the maximum load capacity of the \n\njack stated on the adhesive label attached to the jack. The jack is maintenance-free. If there is a mal- function, please contact a qualified specialist workshop. \n\nVehicles with rear wheel drive \n\nIf you change the wheel size of your vehicle, for instance when changing wheels for winter opera- tion, check it is assigned to the correct wheel size category. If the wheel size category changes, you must have your vehicle's control units recoded at a qualified specialist workshop. Otherwise, the display accuracy of the speedome- ter and the odometer will be outside the legally prescribed tolerance. It may also be lower, i.e. the current road speed is then higher than the speed shown on the speedometer. If a deviation is out- side the range of tolerance, driving safety systems and driving systems may be operationally impaired or may detect a malfunction and switch them- selves off. \n\nInformation on the direction of the tires' rotation \n\nTires with a specified direction of rotation have additional benefits, e.g. if there is a risk of hydro- planing. You will only gain these benefits if the cor- rect direction of rotation is observed. An arrow on the sidewall of the tire indicates its correct direction of rotation. You may also install a spare wheel against the direction of rotation. Observe the time restriction on use as well as the speed limitation specified on the spare wheel. \n\nNotes on storing wheels \n\nThe tire-change tool kit is located in stowage com- partment 1 above the step of the front passenger door and in the stowage compartment in the foot- well on the front passenger side. \n\nPreparing the vehicle for a wheel change \n\nRequirements:  R The tire-change tool kit is available. R The vehicle is not on a slope. R The vehicle is on solid, non-slippery and level \n\nground. \n\n# Apply the parking brake. # Move the front wheels to the straight-ahead \n\nposition. \n\nObserve the following when storing wheels: R Wheels that have been removed should be stored in a cool, dry and, if possible, dark place. \n\nR Protect the tires from oil, grease and fuel. \n\n# Vehicles with automatic transmission: shift the \n\ntransmission to position j. \n\n# Switch off the vehicle. # Make sure that the vehicle cannot be switched \n\non. \n\n# Take the vehicle tool kit from the footwell on \n\nOverview of tire-change tool kit \n\nthe co-driver side (/ page 240). \n\nRequired tire-changing tools may include, for example: R Jack R Wheel wrench \n\n262 Wheels and tires \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury from incorrect \n\npositioning of the jack \n\nIf you do not position the jack correctly at the appropriate jacking point of the vehicle, the jack could tip with the vehicle raised. # Only position the jack at the appropriate jacking point of the vehicle. The base of the jack must be positioned vertically under the jacking point of the vehicle. \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury from vehicle tip- \n\nping \n\nVehicles with rear wheel drive # Take the jack and the tire-change tool kit out of the stowage compartment (/ page 261). \n\nOn slopes, the jack could tip with the vehicle raised. # Never change a wheel on a slope. # Consult a qualified specialist workshop. \n\n# If necessary, remove the wheel trim. # Assemble the lug wrench extension using the middle rod and the rod with the largest diame- ter from the three-piece jack pump lever. # Starting with the middle rod, slide the lug \n\nwrench extension as far as it will go onto the lug wrench. \n\n# Using the lug wrench, loosen the wheel nuts or bolts on the wheel you wish to change by about one full turn. Do not unscrew the wheel nuts or bolts completely. \n\n# Raise the vehicle (/ page 262). \n\n* NOTE Damage to the vehicle due to the \n\njack \n\nIf you do not position the jack at the jack sup- port points provided for this purpose, you could damage your vehicle. # Only position the jack at the jack support \n\npoints provided for this purpose. \n\nRequirements:  R There are no persons in the vehicle. R The vehicle is prepared for changing a wheel \n\n(/ page 261). \n\nRaising the vehicle when changing a wheel \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury due to the jack \n\ntipping over \n\nIf you park a vehicle with air suspension, the air suspension can remain active for up to an hour, even if the vehicle is switched off. If you then raise the vehicle using the jack, the air suspension will attempt to even out the vehicle level. The jack can tip over. # Before raising the vehicle, press the \n\nService button on the remote control for the air suspension. This prevents the vehicle level from being automatically readjusted or manually raised or lowered. \n\nOnly position the jack on the jack support points intended for this purpose. You could otherwise damage the vehicle. Important notes on using the jack: R Only use the vehicle-specific jack that has \n\nbeen tested and approved by Mercedes-Benz to raise the vehicle. If the jack is used incor- rectly, it could tip over while the vehicle is raised. \n\nR The jack is designed only to raise the vehicle \n\nfor a short time while a wheel is being changed and is not suitable for carrying out mainte- nance work under the vehicle. \n\nR Avoid changing a wheel on uphill and downhill \n\nslopes. \n\nR The jack must be placed on a firm, flat and \n\nnon-slip surface. If necessary, use a large, flat, load bearing and non-slip underlay. \n\nR The foot of the jack must be positioned verti- \n\ncally under the jack support point. \n\nWheels and tires 263 \n\nSafety instructions while the vehicle is raised: R Do not put your hands or feet under the vehi- \n\ncle. \n\nR Do not lie underneath the vehicle. R Do not start the vehicle and do not release the \n\n# Close pressure release screw 3. # To do this, use the flattened section on pump lever 1 to turn pressure release screw 3 clockwise to the stop. \n\n% Do not turn pressure release screw 3 more \n\nparking brake. \n\nR Do not open or close any doors. \n\nthan one or two full turns.

Never refuel with the following: R Gasoline R Marine diesel R Heating oil R Pure fatty acid methyl ester (bio-diesel) or \n\nvegetable oil \n\nR Paraffin or kerosene \n\n# Do not mix such fuels with diesel fuel and \n\ndo not use any additive. \n\nIf you have accidentally refueled with the wrong fuel, observe the following: # Do not switch the ignition on. # Consult a qualified specialist workshop. \n\n* NOTE Malfunctions due to contaminated \n\nfuel \n\nFuel contamination can lead to malfunctions in the fuel system. \n\n# If you are using drums or canisters to refuel the vehicle, you should filter the fuel before filling. \n\n* NOTE Damage due to incorrect fuel \n\nIncorrect fuel can lead to engine damage. # Refuel only ULSD or diesel fuel with a sulfur content of maximum 15 ppm. \n\nUsually you will find information about the fuel quality on the fuel dispenser. If there is no identifi- cation on the fuel dispenser, consult a gas station attendant. The fuel quality recommended for your vehicle is found on the information label in the fuel filler flap (/ page 133). \n\nNotes on low outside temperatures \n\n& WARNING Risk of fire and explosion from \n\nigniting fuel \n\nIf you heat up parts of the fuel system, fuel may leak and ignite. Depending on the type of damage, fuel might not escape until the engine is running. # Never heat fuel system components. # Contact a qualified specialist workshop \n\nto rectify the malfunction. \n\nRefill only with commercially available ULTRA-LOW SULFUR DIESEL (ULSD, maximum sulfur content 15 ppm), which fulfills the ASTM D975 standard. The flow properties of diesel fuel may be inade- quate at low outside temperatures due to paraffin separation. % Malfunctions resulting from paraffin separation can only be rectified by heating the entire fuel system. Park the vehicle in a heated garage, for example. \n\nTo prevent malfunctions, diesel fuel with improved flow characteristics is available in the winter months. You can obtain further information on this at the gas station or from your fuel supplier. Your vehicle is equipped with a fuel preheating sys- tem. This additionally improves the flow character- istics of the diesel fuel by about 14.5°F (8°C). ULTRA-LOW SULFUR DIESEL can be used without risk of malfunction down to an outside tempera- ture of approximately 14.5°F (-10°C). \n\nTechnical data 277 \n\n* NOTE Damage due to gasoline or paraffin \n\nReserve fuel tank (gasoline engines) \n\nGasoline or paraffin in diesel fuel impairs the lubricity of the diesel fuel. This can result in damage to the diesel injection system, for example. # Do not add any gasoline or paraffin to \n\nGasoline engine \n\nReserve \n\nM274 \n\nApprox. 5 US gal (19 liters) \n\nFuel tank total capacity (diesel engines) \n\ndiesel fuel to improve its flow character- istics. \n\nDiesel engine \n\nTotal capacity \n\nB20 fuels with bio-diesel content \n\nOM642 OM651 \n\nApprox. 25 US gal (93 liters) \n\n* NOTE Damage due to incorrect fuel \n\nContinuous use of fuels with bio-diesel content over 5% (B20 fuels) can lead to fuel filter clog- ging. Deposits may also form on the fuel injec- tor. This may reduce the engine output. Unburned fuel can get into the oil pan. This causes the engine oil level to rise. This can cause engine mechanical damage. Observe the following points to avoid damage and reducing the engine output: # Fill up with fuels with bio-diesel content of 5% (ULSD) or less, whenever possible. \n\n# Regularly check your engine oil level if you use B20 fuels on a regular basis. # Strictly follow the oil change intervals quoted in the instrument cluster and within your Maintenance Booklet. \n\n# Use only engine oils and filters approved \n\nfor use in your vehicle. \n\n# If you do not plan to drive your vehicle for several weeks, completely fill the fuel tank in advance with ULSD fuel. \n\nOM654 \n\nApprox. 21 gal (93 liters) or Approx. 16 gal (71 liters) \n\nReserve fuel tank (diesel engines) \n\nDiesel engine \n\nReserve \n\nOM642 OM651 \n\nApprox. 5 US gal (19 liters) \n\nOM654 \n\nApprox. 3.2 US gal (12 liters) \n\nDEF (vehicles with a diesel engine only) \n\n▌Notes on DEF® Observe the notes on operating fluids (/ page 274). DEF® is a water-soluble fluid for the exhaust gas aftertreatment of diesel engines. \n\nFor more information, consult the gas station staff. The identification of fuels with bio-diesel content (ULSD or B20) must be clear. If the identification is not clear, do not refuel. Do not refuel with any fuels that have not been approved for your vehicle. \n\n▌Tank content and fuel reserve The total capacity of the fuel tank may vary, depending on the vehicle equipment. \n\n* NOTE Irritation of skin, eyes and respira- \n\ntory tract by DEF \n\nDEF may be irritating if inhaled, swallowed or if it comes in contact with eyes or skin.

R If DEF has gotten into the eyes, rinse the \n\neyes with water for 15 minutes, also under the eyelids. \n\nR Immediately rinse off DEF from the skin \n\nwith water. \n\n* NOTE Damage caused by additives in DEF \n\nor by diluting DEF \n\nThe DEF exhaust gas aftertreatment system could be destroyed by the following: R Additives in DEF R Diluting DEF \n\n# Only use DEF in accordance with ISO \n\n22241. \n\n# Do not mix additives. # Do not dilute DEF. \n\n* NOTE Damage and malfunctions caused \n\nby impurities in DEF \n\nImpurities in DEF result in the following: R Higher emission values R Damage to the catalytic converter R Engine damage R Malfunctions in the DEF exhaust gas after- \n\ntreatment system \n\n# Avoid impurities in DEF. \n\n+ ENVIRONMENTAL NOTE Soiling with DEF DEF residue crystallizes after some time and stain the affected surfaces. # Immediately rinse surfaces that come in contact with DEF when filling with water or remove DEF with a damp cloth and cold water. \n\nExhaust gas aftertreatment The vehicle must be operated with DEF® if the exhaust gas aftertreatment system is to function correctly. If you operate the vehicle without DEF® or with emissions-relevant malfunctions, the legal operat- ing permit is invalidated. The vehicle could be pro- hibited from public road use by an official ordi- nance. It may be improper or punishable in some coun- tries to operate a vehicle that uses no DEF® or one that does not comply with the specifications of this operator's manual. Engine management monitors the exhaust gas aftertreatment components for compliance with emissions laws and regulations. If you attempt to operate the vehicle without DEF®, with diluted DEF® or with a different reducing agent, this will be detected by the engine management. Other emissions-relevant malfunctions, e.g. metering malfunctions or sensor errors, are also detected and logged. The engine management system subsequently pre- vents the engine being restarted after issuing a warning message. Therefore refill DEF® tank regularly during vehicle operation or, at the latest, after receiving the first warning message via the instrument cluster. \n\n▌DEF® consumption and filling quantity \n\nDEF® consumption Like fuel consumption, DEF® consumption is highly dependent upon driving style and operating condi- tions. DEF® consumption is usually within a range of 0 and 10% of the fuel consumption. If necessary, DEF® must be refilled in accordance with the instructions when the refill message is displayed in the instrument cluster. This may also be necessary between the scheduled maintenance. \n\nTotal capacity of DEF® tank \n\nModel \n\nAll models \n\nTotal capacity \n\n5.8 gal (22 liters ) \n\nIf DEF has already crystallized, clean using a sponge and cold water. \n\nEngine oil \n\nIf you open the DEF® tank, small amounts of ammonia vapor may be released. Do not inhale any ammonia vapors that may be released. Only fill the DEF® tank in well-ventilated areas. \n\n▌Notes on engine oil Observe the notes on operating fluids (/ page 274). \n\nTechnical data 279 \n\nMB-Freigabe or MB-Approval (gasoline engines) \n\nGasoline engines \n\nMB-Freigabe or MB- Approval \n\nM274 \n\n229.51) \n\n1) Recommended for lowest possible fuel consumption (lowest SAE  \n\nviscosity class in each case; observe possible restrictions of the  \n\napproved SAE viscosity classes). \n\n* NOTE Engine damage caused by an incor- rect oil filter, incorrect oil or additives \n\n# Do not use engine oils or oil filters other than those which meet the specifications necessary for the prescribed service intervals. \n\nMB-Freigabe or MB-Approval (diesel engines) \n\nDiesel engines \n\nMB-Freigabe or MB- Approval \n\nOM642 OM651 \n\n228.51, 229.31, 229.51, 229.521) \n\n# Do not alter the engine oil or oil filter in order to achieve longer change intervals than prescribed. # Do not use additives. # Have the engine oil changed after the \n\nOM654 \n\n228.51, 229.31, 229.51, 229.52, 229.711) \n\n1) Recommended for lowest possible fuel consumption (lowest SAE  \n\nviscosity class in each case; observe possible restrictions of the  \n\nprescribed intervals. \n\napproved SAE viscosity classes). \n\nMercedes-Benz recommends having the oil changed at a qualified specialist workshop. Further information on engine oil and oil filters: R in the MB Specifications for operating fluids at https://operatingfluids.mercedes-benz.com (under specification designation). R at a qualified specialist workshop \n\n▌Engine oil quality and filling capacity % The containers of the various engine oils are marked with the ACEA (Association of Euro- pean Automotive Manufacturers) and/or API (American Petroleum Institute) classifications. Use only approved engine oils that correspond to the MB Specifications for Operating Fluids and the prescribed ACEA and/or API classifi- cations named below. Engine oils of other grades are not permissible and may result in the loss of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. The use of other engine oils not approved for diesel engines can damage the diesel particu- late filter (DPF). \n\nTo achieve the lowest possible fuel consumption, it is recommended to use the engine oil specifica- tions marked in the table for the lowest SAE vis- cosity class. Observe any possible restrictions of the approved SAE viscosity classes. % If the engine oils listed in the table are not \n\navailable, you may add a maximum 1.1 US qt (1.0 liter) of the following engine oils once only: Vehicles with gasoline engines: MB-Freigabe or MB-Approval 229.3 or ACEA A3/B4 Vehicles with diesel engines: MB-Freigabe or MB-Approval 228.5, 229.3 or 229.5 \n\nMultigrade engine oils of the prescribed SAE vis- cosity class may be used all year round, taking the outside temperature into account. \n\nViscosity of the engine oil \n\n* NOTE Engine damage due to incorrect SAE \n\nclassification (viscosity) of the engine oil \n\nIf the SAE classification (viscosity) of the engine oil added is not suitable for prolonged low outside temperatures, it may cause engine damage. The temperature readings of the SAE classifi- cation are always based on fresh oil. Engine oil ages when driving as a result of soot and fuel \n\n280 Technical data \n\nresidue. The characteristics of engine oil dete- riorate significantly at low outside tempera- tures. # Use an engine oil of the appropriate SAE classification at low outside tempera- tures. \n\n# Use oil for all-year-round operation. \n\nThe temperature readings of the SAE viscosity class are always based on fresh oil. The tempera- ture characteristics of the engine oil, especially at low outside temperatures, can deteriorate signifi- cantly due to aging during driving. Therefore, Mercedes-Benz recommends that you change the engine oil before the start of the cold season. Use only an approved engine oil in the pre- scribed SAE viscosity class for this purpose. \n\nWe recommend that you use only engine oil of the same grade and SAE viscosity class as the oil filled at the last oil change. If, in exceptional cases, engine oil of the type in the engine is not available, use another approved mineral or synthetic engine oil. Vehicles with diesel engines: if the grade is not available, you may also refill with engine oils according to MB-Freigabe or MB-Approval 228.5, 229.3 or 229.5. The top-up quantity will then be limited to a maximum of 1.1 US qt (1.0 liter). Vehicles with gasoline engines: if the grade is not available, you may refill with engine oils according to MB-Freigabe or MB-Approval 229.3 or ACEA A3/B4. The top-up quantity will then be limi- ted to a maximum of 1.1 US qt (1.0 liter). You must then have an oil change carried out at the earliest possible opportunity. Engine oils are differentiated according to: R Engine oil brand R Grade (MB-Freigabe or MB-Approval) R SAE viscosity class \n\nThe viscosity indicates the flow characteristics of a fluid. With regard to engine oil, a high viscosity is synonymous with thick liquid and a low viscosity with thin liquid. Depending on the outside temper- atures, select the engine oil according to the SAE viscosity class. The table shows the SAE viscosity class to be used. The low temperature characteris- tics of engine oils can deteriorate significantly dur- ing operation due to aging, soot and fuel accretion, for example. A regular oil change with an approved engine oil in the appropriate SAE viscosity class is therefore strongly recommended. \n\nAdditives \n\nOil change interval The on-board computer automatically shows the date of the next oil change as an event message on the display.

Distrib- ute the load on the cargo tie-down points evenly. \n\nNominal tensile force is the maximum permissible tensile load. Further information on the cargo tie-down points and cargo tie-down rings can be obtained in the \"Transporting\" section (/ page 209). \n\nCargo tie-down rings \n\nNominal tensile load of cargo tie-down rings \n\nCargo tie-down rings \n\nNominal tensile load \n\nPassenger van \n\n786.5 lbf (350 daN) \n\nCargo van \n\n1798.5 lbf (800 daN) \n\nThe body builder label is found on the front-end module above the radiator and contains the maxi- mum permissible curb weight for the vehicles. \n\n288 Technical data \n\nLoading rails \n\nNominal tensile load of cargo tie-down point in the cargo compartment \n\nCargo tie-down point \n\nLoading rails on cargo floor \n\nLower loading rail on side wall \n\nUpper loading rail on side wall \n\nNominal tensile load \n\n1124.0 lbf (500 daN) \n\n449.6 lbf (200 daN) \n\n281.0 lbf (125 daN) \n\n* NOTE Risk of accident if the maximum permissible roof load is exceeded \n\nIf the weight of the roof luggage, including the roof rack, exceeds the maximum permissible roof load, there will be a risk of an accident. # Ensure that the weight of the roof lug- \n\ngage and roof rack does not exceed the maximum permissible roof load. \n\n# The roof rack supports must be arranged at an even distance from each other. # Mercedes-Benz advises you to install a stabilizer on the vehicle's front axle. \n\nThe values specified apply only to loads resting on the cargo floor under the following circumstances: Conditions: R The load is secured to two cargo tie-down \n\nFurther information about safety measures can be found in the \"Transport\" section (/ page 209). \n\nMax. roof load/pairs of roof rack supports \n\npoints on the rail \n\nVehicles with \n\nR the distance to the nearest load-securing point on the same rail is approximately 3 ft (1 m) \n\nMaximum  roof load \n\nMinimum  number of  pairs of sup- ports \n\nInformation about roof luggage racks \n\nRoof \n\n661 lbs (300 kg) \n\n6 \n\n& WARNING Risk of injury if maximum roof \n\nload is exceeded \n\nThe vehicle center of gravity and the usual driv- ing characteristics as well as the steering and braking characteristics will change. If you exceed the maximum roof load, the han- dling as well as steering and braking character- istics are severely affected. # Always comply with the maximum roof load and adjust your driving style. \n\nHigh roof \n\n331 lbs (150 kg) \n\n3 \n\nThis information applies if the load is distributed evenly across the entire roof area. If the roof luggage rack is shorter, reduce the load proportionately. The maximum load per pair of roof rack supports is 110 lbs (50 kg). The loading guidelines and other information about load distribution and load securing can be found in the \"Transport\" section (/ page 209). \n\n& WARNING Danger of accident due to \n\nuneven loading \n\nThe driving characteristics, as well as steering and braking characteristics, may be greatly impaired. # Load the vehicle evenly. # Secure the load against sliding. \n\nThe driving, braking and steering characteristics of the vehicle will change with the type of load, the weight and the center of gravity of the load. \n\nDisplay messages and warning and indicator lamps 289 \n\nDisplay messages \n\nIntroduction \n\n▌Function of display messages Display messages appear on the instrument clus- ter.
